Looking at your codebase, logs, and routing structure, I can identify several pages/features that lead to 404s, 401s, or dead-ends. Here's my analysis:

Pages Leading to 404s (Route Not Found)
1. CRM Module Routes
/crm/accounts - No backend route exists for /api/crm/accounts
/crm/activities - No backend route exists for /api/crm/activities
/crm/form-templates - No backend route exists for /api/crm/form-templates
/crm/qualification - No backend route exists for /api/crm/qualification
/crm/surveys - No backend route exists for /api/crm/surveys
2. Finance Module Routes
/finance - Frontend page exists but no corresponding backend routes in /api/finance/
3. Marketing Module Routes
/marketing - Frontend page exists but no backend implementation
4. Time Tracking Module
/time-tracking - Frontend page exists but backend shows "tasks (schema exists but table missing)" in project_inventory.json
5. Client Portal
/client-portal - Frontend page exists but no backend routes for client portal functionality
6. Gamification
/gamification - Frontend page exists but no backend implementation
Pages Leading to 401s (Authentication Issues)
1. Protected Routes Without Proper Auth Middleware
/admin/* routes when user doesn't have sufficient role level (requires level 4-5)
/settings/commission-policies - Requires admin privileges but may not have proper auth checks
2. API Endpoints with Missing Auth
/api/dashboard/consolidated - Referenced in logs but route doesn't exist in consolidated-routes.ts
/api/organization/current vs /api/organizations/current - Inconsistent route naming causing 404s
Dead-End Features (Incomplete Implementation)
1. Notifications System
Frontend makes calls to /api/notifications but backend implementation is partial
Schema exists but table creation is missing according to project_inventory.json
2. Messages/Conversations
Frontend repeatedly calls /api/messages/conversations (visible in logs)
Backend route exists but likely returns empty data or errors
3. Tasks Management
/tasks page exists in frontend
Backend shows "tasks (schema exists but table missing)" - incomplete database setup
4. Time Clock Entries
Time tracking functionality has schema but no table creation
Frontend page exists but backend storage is incomplete
5. Commission Policies Settings
Frontend page /settings/commission-policies exists
Backend has some commission logic but policy management is incomplete
Specific Route Inconsistencies
1. Organization Routes Mismatch
Frontend calls /api/organization/current (singular)
Backend defines /api/organizations/current (plural)
This causes 404s as seen in logs
2. UI Preferences Route Issues
Frontend calls /api/ui-prefs/me
Logs show "Failed to fetch UI preferences" errors
Route exists but may have middleware issues
3. Auth Route Inconsistencies
Some auth checks use /api/auth/me with timestamps
Multiple redundant calls visible in logs suggesting frontend retry logic issues
Database Schema vs Implementation Gaps
Based on project_inventory.json, these features have schema but missing tables:

Notifications - Schema exists, table missing
Tasks - Schema exists, table missing
Time Clock Entries - Schema exists, table missing
Root Causes
Frontend-Backend Route Mismatch - Many frontend pages make API calls to non-existent backend routes
Incomplete Database Migrations - Tables not created despite schema definitions
Missing Authentication Middleware - Some routes lack proper role-based access control
Inconsistent Route Naming - Singular vs plural route naming causing 404s
Partial Feature Implementation - Frontend UI exists but backend logic incomplete
These issues explain why users may encounter 404s when navigating to certain pages or 401s when trying to access restricted functionality without proper permissions.
