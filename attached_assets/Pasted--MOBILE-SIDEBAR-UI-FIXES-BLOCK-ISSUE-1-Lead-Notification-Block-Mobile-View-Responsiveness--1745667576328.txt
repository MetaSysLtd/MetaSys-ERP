[MOBILE & SIDEBAR UI FIXES BLOCK]

ðŸ”µ ISSUE 1: Lead Notification Block (Mobile View Responsiveness)

Problem:
The Lead Notifications panel (Assigned Leads / Follow-up / Inactive / Status Changes) is broken on mobile â€”
UI overflows, tabs are squeezed, not adaptive.

Fix Instructions:

âœ… Make Lead Notifications container fully responsive using Tailwind/Grid:

On Mobile (<768px screen width):

Tabs should become horizontally scrollable OR stack vertically (preferred = horizontal scroll).

Use flex-wrap OR overflow-x-auto on the tab container.



âœ… Ensure buttons inside this block have:

Larger touch targets (min-height: 44px, min-width: 44px per Google Mobile UX guidelines)

Adequate padding

Font size no less than 14px on mobile


âœ… The entire Lead Notifications card should have max-width: 95% of screen width, centered, with padding/margin.

âœ… Adjust vertical spacing: tabs â†’ content (more breathing room).

âœ… Auto-scale font sizes slightly smaller on mobile view if needed using Tailwind text-sm at sm: breakpoint.

ðŸ”µ ISSUE 2: Where the Lead Notification Block Is Shown (Wrong Locations)

Problem:
Right now, Lead Notifications panel is incorrectly being rendered on every module (e.g., Settings, HR, Finance).

Fix Instructions:

âœ… Restrict rendering of Lead Notifications component:

Only show on the Dashboard routes:

/dashboard

/dispatch/dashboard

/sales/dashboard (future sales dashboard if needed)



âœ… DO NOT render Lead Notifications when navigating to:

Settings

Profile

Admin Management

Finance

HR

Marketing

Any detailed views (e.g., Client Detail, Load Detail, Lead Detail)


âœ… How to do this:

Use conditional rendering inside the layout or page components.

Example pseudo-code:


if (currentRoute.includes('/dashboard')) {
  show <LeadNotifications />
} else {
  hide <LeadNotifications />
}

âœ… Additionally:

If you ever create future dashboards (e.g., Marketing Dashboard), remember to opt-in explicitly. Default = HIDDEN.

ðŸ”µ ISSUE 3: Sidebar Auto-Collapse on Mobile

Problem:
On mobile, when a user clicks a module (e.g., CRM, Dispatch), the sidebar remains open.
User must manually dismiss by clicking outside â€” annoying UX.

Fix Instructions:

âœ… Sidebar behavior on mobile:

When any menu item is clicked:

Immediately collapse/close the sidebar

Navigate to selected page

Do not wait for manual outside-click to collapse



âœ… How to do it:

Add an event inside menu item click handler:


onMenuItemClick = () => {
  navigateToPage()
  closeSidebar()   // Automatically trigger sidebar collapse
}

âœ… Use Tailwind transitions if needed for smooth collapse (e.g., transition-width duration-300 ease-in-out).

âœ… Also ensure:

Touch gestures swipe sidebar closed (optional bonus, future).

Sidebar expands properly again on hamburger click.

No flickering or ghost clicks when collapsing.



---

âœ… FINAL EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

âœ… On Mobile (<768px):

Sidebar collapses automatically after any click.

Lead Notifications are responsive, clean, scrollable, visible.

Only Dashboards show Lead Notifications.

All other modules remain clean without the sticky block.


âœ… On Desktop:

Lead Notifications show only on dashboards.

Sidebar behaves as normal (expand/collapse manually).
