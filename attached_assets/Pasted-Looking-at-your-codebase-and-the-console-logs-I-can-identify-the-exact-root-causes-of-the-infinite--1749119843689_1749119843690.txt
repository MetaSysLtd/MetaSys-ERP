Looking at your codebase and the console logs, I can identify the exact root causes of the infinite API loops and explain why they're occurring. Let me break this down systematically:

Primary Root Cause: Socket Handler Cycling
The main culprit is in SocketContext.tsx. Here's what's happening:

useEffect(() => {
  if (!user) return;
  // Socket setup code...
  return () => {
    socketInstance.disconnect();
    setSocket(null);
    setConnected(false);
  };
}, [user, toast]); // ‚Üê THE PROBLEM: `toast` dependency
Why this causes infinite loops:

The toast function from useToast() gets recreated on every render
This triggers the useEffect to re-run
Socket disconnects and reconnects continuously
Each reconnection triggers authentication checks
Authentication checks trigger more renders
More renders = new toast function = cycle repeats
Evidence from logs:

["Setting up handler for connect"]
["Removing handler for connect"] 
["Setting up handler for disconnect"]
["Removing handler for disconnect"]
Secondary Cause: Commission Components Bypassing Consolidated Hook
Looking at dashboard/index.tsx, I can see:

// The dashboard uses useDashboardData hook (GOOD)
const {
  isLoading: dashboardLoading,
  kpiData,
  revenueData,
  activitiesData,
  commissionData
} = useDashboardData();
// BUT commission components are still making independent calls (BAD)
<CommissionBreakdown 
  isAdmin={role && role.level ? role.level >= 4 : false}
/>
<CommissionPerformance 
  type={user?.roleId === 5 || user?.roleId === 6 ? 'dispatch' : 'sales'}
/>
The Problem: CommissionBreakdown-clean.tsx and CommissionPerformance.tsx likely contain their own useQuery calls instead of using the commissionData prop from the consolidated hook.

Tertiary Cause: Multiple Dashboard Files
I see you have multiple dashboard implementations:

dashboard/index.tsx (using consolidated hook)
dashboard/fixed-dashboard.tsx (using individual API calls)
dashboard/safe-dashboard.tsx (using individual API calls)
If multiple dashboard files are being used or imported somewhere, they could be triggering competing API calls.

Authentication Loop Amplification
From the console logs:

["Making query to:","/api/auth/me"]
["Making query to:","/api/auth/user-organizations"] 
["Making query to:","/api/organizations/current"]
These authentication calls are happening because:

Socket reconnections trigger auth checks
Multiple components are independently checking auth status
The auth context is probably re-rendering due to socket state changes
Why the Agent's Previous Fixes Didn't Work
The Agent created the useDashboardData hook correctly with:

Infinite staleTime/gcTime
Proper dependency management
Single consolidated endpoint
But the fixes failed because:

Socket cycling wasn't addressed - the root cause remains
Commission components weren't updated to use the consolidated data
Multiple dashboard files exist - unclear which one is actually being used
No cleanup of old useQuery calls in commission components
The Complete Fix Strategy (Understanding Only)
To completely eliminate the infinite loops, you would need to:

1. Fix Socket Context Dependencies
Remove toast from the useEffect dependency array and handle errors differently.

2. Update Commission Components
Modify CommissionBreakdown-clean.tsx and CommissionPerformance.tsx to:

Remove all useQuery calls
Accept data as props from the consolidated hook
Use the commissionData passed down from the main dashboard
3. Cleanup Dashboard Files
Determine which dashboard file is actually being used and remove the others to prevent confusion.

4. Verify Consolidated Endpoint
Ensure /api/dashboard/consolidated actually exists and returns all necessary data.

Why This Matters
The infinite loops are causing:

Performance degradation (constant API calls)
Database strain (unnecessary queries)
User experience issues (visible reloads/refreshes)
Authentication instability (session checks)
Memory leaks (socket handlers piling up)
The core issue is dependency management in React hooks - when dependencies change unnecessarily, it triggers cascading re-renders that create feedback loops. The socket context is the primary trigger, but the commission components amplify the problem by making independent API calls that should be consolidated.
