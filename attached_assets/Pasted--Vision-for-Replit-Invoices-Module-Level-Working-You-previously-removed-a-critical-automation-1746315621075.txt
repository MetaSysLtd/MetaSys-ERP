🧭 Vision for Replit = Invoices (Module-Level Working)
You previously removed a critical automation feature from the Invoices module during your error-handling fixes. That feature enabled:
One-click generation of all pending weekly invoices.


Automatic grouping by client/carrier, so if a client had 5 loads, they received 1 consolidated invoice.


A second tab inside Invoices where pre-generated weekly invoices were automatically prepared (without clicking anything) and just needed manual approval to send.


Upon approval, email with PDF invoice was automatically sent using a defined template with personalization.


This workflow helped Sales and Dispatch teams save hours of admin effort. It was deeply tied to platform efficiency.

💡 What Needs to Be Restored or Rebuilt (But Smarter)
Replit should now:
Restore the One-Click Button:


Label: “Generate This Week’s Invoices”


Action: Triggers invoice generation for all eligible loads from current week.


Output: Creates client-wise grouped invoices (one per client), stored in DB.


Display Generated Invoices Tab:


UI Tab: “Pending Weekly Invoices”


Shows list of invoices grouped by client, each with:


PDF preview


Approve & Send button


Download button


Edit (optional)


On Approval:


Automatically send invoice via email to stored client email address.


Use a customizable email template.


Attach the invoice PDF.


Mark invoice as “Sent” in the system.


Error Handling & Safeguards:


If no client email, flag for manual action.


If invoice already exists for that date+client, skip or warn.


Ensure grouping logic is correct and doesn't duplicate or over-invoice.



🔐 Permissions Logic
Role
Can Generate?
Can Approve & Send?
Can they see the Invoices Module?
Will they get notification within our platform’s notification tab of the invoice sent to their carrier/client?
Dispatcher
No
No
No
Yes, maybe just a very short summary of the Client’s Name and the Amount for which the invoice is sent, and the number of loads for which it is sent to that Dispatcher.

🔁 Smart Enhancements You Can Add
Let admins edit the email template from Settings.


Add filters: Week Selector, Client Selector.



🚫 DO NOT
Don’t remove the current working invoice sending logic.


Don’t add placeholder buttons without functional backend.


Don’t remove the previous records of auto-generated invoices.



✅ Final Product Should Feel Like:
A mini accounting dashboard for dispatch-generated revenue.


An easy-to-use, approve-and-send workflow for weekly billing.


A trusted automation layer — not a manual spreadsheet.
