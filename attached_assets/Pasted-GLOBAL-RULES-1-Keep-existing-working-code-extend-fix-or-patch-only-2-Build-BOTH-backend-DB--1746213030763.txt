GLOBAL RULES
1. Keep existing working code; extend, fix, or patch only.
2. Build BOTH backend (DB, API, sockets) and frontend (UI).
3. All data changes must emit socket events for real‑time dashboards.
4. Follow brand button style:Primary: #025E73, #011F26 Secondary: #F2A71B, #412754  text-white  rounded-md  transition-all  duration-200. Font = Inter (Google Fonts)
Before you build any of these features below, ensure every new function:
- Connects to the related parent module correctly (CRM, Dispatch, HR, etc.)
- Reports relevant activity back to Admin Dashboard KPIs (if applicable)
- Triggers notifications internally (Notification Center, Bell Icon, Slack)
- Is fully permission-based (who can view, who can edit)
- Follows the brand design system (primary/secondary colors, button styles)
- Is fully mobile responsive and accessible. Dark Mode also works
- No standalone isolated features are allowed.

Task: Fix and restructure the sidebar navigation and page routing for MetaSys ERP.

🔹 1. Rename “Sales” → “CRM” in the sidebar.
- "CRM" must be a **primary module**, not under “Sales”.
- CRM should have 3 working sub-modules:
  • Leads
  • Clients
  • Commissions

🔹 2. Submodule Routing:
- Each CRM submodule must open its own unique route:
  • CRM > Leads → /crm/leads
  • CRM > Clients → /crm/clients
  • CRM > Commissions → /crm/commissions

🔹 3. Dispatch Routing:
- Dispatch must remain a separate primary module.
- It should include:
  • Dispatch > Loads → /dispatch/loads
  • Dispatch > Clients → /dispatch/clients
  • Dispatch > New Load → /dispatch/new-load
  • Dispatch > Load Tracking → /dispatch/tracking

🔹 4. Fix all broken sidebar routes that currently give 404 or “Unexpected Token” errors.
- Test for all CRM and Dispatch sub-routes after fixing.

🔹 5. Hide modules that are still in development (like Marketing, HR, Finance, Client Portal) if they’re not functional.
- Use a `hidden: true` flag or conditional in sidebar config.

🔹 6. Add Sidebar Expand/Collapse Toggle (Desktop):
- Add a button in the sidebar to collapse the entire menu on web view.
- On small screens, sidebar should auto-collapse after clicking any menu item.

🔹 7. Logo Click Route:
- Clicking the MetaSys ERP logo in the top left should route to:
  • Super Admins → /admin/dashboard
  • Others → /dashboard (based on their default dashboard permission)

After implementing the above:
✅ Return “PASS” if all modules and routes open without error and are named correctly.
✅ Notify if any sidebar items are left hidden.
