Project Title: MetaSys ERP MVP Requirements Document

1. Overview

A custom, scalable, and modular ERP tailored for MetaSys Limited. The initial MVP will focus on:

Sales Module (lead management, conversions, and commission tracking)

Dispatch Module (load booking, rate confirmations, and invoicing)

Integrated Invoicing & Commission System

Over time, this will evolve into a full-fledged ERP (Finance, HR, etc.). All features must be carefully designed for operational efficiency, reliable data flow, and role-based security.

2. Objectives

Centralize WorkflowsReplace multiple manual tools (Google Forms, Sheets, Slack messages) with a single system that tracks every step of the process, from lead qualification to final invoicing.

Scalability & ModularityThe system’s architecture must accommodate new modules or third-party integrations with minimal rework.

Collaboration & ReportingOffer real-time visibility of performance metrics, plus automatic daily/weekly/monthly reports via Slack/Email.

Role-Based AccessEnforce restricted data visibility at each level (Reps, Team Leads, Managers, Heads, Super Admin), ensuring no accidental data leaks.

Third-Party Integrations

Communication: Slack, Google Voice, WhatsApp Business, RingCentral.

Productivity & Document: Google Sheets/Docs, PDF signing.

Time Tracking: Jebel Klocken.

Email: Automated notifications (invoices, reminders).Future integrations must be pluggable with minimal disruption.

3. Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js (component-based, easily expandable)

Backend: Node.js + Express.js

Database: MongoDB (flexible document model for leads, dispatch orders, etc.)

Authentication & Authorization:

JWT-based login

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for data permissions

Deployment:

Containerized (Docker)

Cloud hosting (AWS, Azure, or equivalent)

4. Core MVP Modules

4.1 Sales Module

4.1.1 Users & Roles

Sales Rep

Sales Team Lead

Sales Manager

Head of Sales

Super Admin

4.1.2 Lead Management Workflow

Lead Capture

Web form with fields: MC Number (must be older than 6 months to qualify), DOT, Equipment Type, Truck Category, Factoring Status, Contact Info, Service Charges, etc.

If MC < 6 months, system auto-flags as “Unqualified.”

System checks for duplicates by MC + phone or MC + email to avoid re-entry.

Qualification & Status Tracking

Statuses: Unqualified, Qualified, Active, Lost, Won, Follow-Up, Nurture.

Sales Reps manually update the status or schedule follow-ups.

Automatic email or Slack reminders for nurturing or callback.

Call Metrics

Initially, Reps may manually enter calls made vs. successful connections.

The system can later integrate with dialers (RingCentral, etc.) for real-time call logs.

Handoff to Dispatch

Upon client agreement, the Sales Rep changes lead status to “Active” and sets any negotiated rate (percentage or flat fee).

Dispatch Team Lead receives a notification of the new “Active” carrier.

All relevant lead data transfers automatically (MC, factoring, contact info, preferences).

Feedback & Testimonial Tracking

System schedules periodic check-ins for the Sales Rep (e.g., every 2 weeks) to call or email the carrier, gather feedback, and request testimonials.

Each feedback record is stored in the carrier’s profile for future reference.

4.1.3 Sales Reporting & Visibility

Sales Reps:

View daily tasks, calls, conversions, and basic lead statuses.

Limited to only leads assigned to them or created by them.

Sales Team Leads:

View aggregated weekly stats (calls, conversions) for their sub-team.

Can see daily data for quick oversight.

Sales Managers:

Monthly performance metrics for all their team leads.

Access to team breakdown, daily or weekly if needed.

Head of Sales / Super Admin:

Full departmental visibility.

Can view historical data across any timeframe.

4.1.4 Sales Commissions

Sales – Dispatch

Base Criteria: 2 qualified leads per agent to earn 10% of the first invoice after the allocated target is reached.

Sales – Factoring

PKR 7,000 per qualified factoring lead.

Sales – Direct Contracts

PKR 8,000 per closed lead.

Sales – Digital Marketing

PKR 5,000 per closed lead.

High Volume Bonus (>100 leads):

Special perks (e.g., visit to Dubai office or other incentives).

All commission calculations factor in the actual revenue generated by the lead. The system accumulates these amounts and presents them on a user’s dashboard to provide transparency.

4.2 Dispatch Module

4.2.1 Users & Roles

Dispatch Rep

Dispatch Team Lead

Dispatch Manager

Head of Dispatch

Super Admin

4.2.2 Dispatch Workflow

Lead Reception

When Sales marks a lead “Active,” Dispatch Team Lead is notified.

Team Lead assigns the carrier to a Dispatch Rep or keeps it personally.

Load Booking

Dispatch Reps search external load boards (DAT, TruckStop).

Once carrier approves the load, Rep proceeds with broker negotiation.

Broker shares Rate Confirmation (Rate Con).

Rate Confirmation Handling

Rep uploads Rate Con (PDF) into the system.

Internal e-sign capability (optional) to sign and forward to broker + carrier.

System stores the PDF, associates it with the lead record for future reference.

Pickup & Delivery

System tracks load details: origin, destination, pickup date, drop date, final rate, etc.

After delivery, Rep gathers Proof of Delivery (POD).

Load Completion & Invoice Prep

Rep finalizes load details: freight amount, agreed service charges (percentage or flat).

System marks the load “Completed,” automatically generating an invoice line item.

4.2.3 Dispatch Reporting & Visibility

Dispatch Reps:

View their assigned carriers, loads, daily performance.

No access to other Reps’ data for confidentiality.

Dispatch Team Leads:

View aggregated weekly data for their sub-team (loads booked, revenue generated).

Evaluate daily performance as needed.

Dispatch Managers:

Monthly roll-up of multiple teams, including total loads, total invoice amount, and monthly targets.

Head of Dispatch / Super Admin:

Full view of historical and real-time data across the department.

4.2.4 Dispatch Commissions

Calculated on a monthly invoice cleared by each agent:

Min $650: Eligible for base salary only.

$651–$850: 2.5% commission.

$851–$1500: 5.0%.

$1501–$2500: 10.0%.

$2501–$3300: 13.5%.

>$3301: 17.0%.

The system automatically tallies each Rep’s total invoiced amount and applies the corresponding tier percentage.

4.3 Invoicing Module

Invoice Generation

Weekly cycle: Sunday close for all loads delivered Monday–Friday.

System consolidates each carrier’s loads into one invoice per week.

Each load line item includes load reference, dispatch fee, and total.

Exception handling:

Loads delivered on weekends can be pushed to the next cycle or handled separately.

Partial payments or short pays can be tracked if needed.

Invoice Delivery

Automatic PDF generation with full details.

Emailed to the carrier with a link to view or download.

System logs email sent, records timestamp.

Payment Tracking

Mark invoice as Paid once payment is received (ACH, Zelle, QuickPay, etc.).

Triggers an automated “Payment Acknowledged” email to the carrier.

Commission & Reporting Integration

When an invoice is marked Paid, the system updates the relevant agent’s monthly commission tally (Sales or Dispatch).

Commissions become part of the agent’s final monthly report.

5. Role Hierarchy & Access Control

Super Admin

Creates departments, user accounts, sets or edits commission structures, sees all data.

Manages advanced system settings.

Head of Department (Sales/Dispatch)

High-level monthly/quarterly performance.

Department-wide policy adjustments, final approvals.

Manager

Oversees multiple teams, reviews monthly aggregated data.

Manages escalations, sets team targets.

Team Lead

Oversees day-to-day operations for a small team.

Approves or verifies data (e.g., call reports, lead qualification, final load details).

Rep/Agent

Limited to their own leads, loads, data entries, commission tracking.

Views daily performance metrics only, no historical or cross-team data.

Privacy & Security

Sales data is hidden from Dispatch, and Dispatch data is hidden from Sales.

Even within the same department, cross-team data is restricted for Reps. Managers and above have broader access.

6. Notifications & Automation

Daily Summaries

Slack + Email notices for each team, capturing calls made, loads booked, invoices generated.

Task Reminders

Follow-up calls, feedback requests, invoice due checks.

Notification triggers can be customized per role.

Performance Insights

The system can compare actual performance vs. target in near real-time.

Visual dashboards show daily, weekly, and monthly progress.

Commission Dashboard

Each user sees their commission progress based on monthly or weekly invoice clearances.

Displays graphs (bar charts, pie charts) or numeric breakdowns.

7. Data Security & Audit Trails

Authentication: Username/Password, optional multi-factor.

RBAC: Fine-grained permissions, ensuring each user only accesses authorized data.

Audit Logs: Track who changes lead statuses, modifies load details, or marks invoices as paid.

Document Storage: Secure cloud or on-prem solutions for storing MC Authority Letters, W-9 Forms, Rate Confirmations, etc.
