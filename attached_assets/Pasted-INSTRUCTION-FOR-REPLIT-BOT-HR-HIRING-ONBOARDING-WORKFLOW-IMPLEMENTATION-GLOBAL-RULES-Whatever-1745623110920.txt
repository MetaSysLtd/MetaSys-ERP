INSTRUCTION FOR REPLIT BOT: HR HIRING & ONBOARDING WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION
{GLOBAL RULES}
✅ Whatever you build MUST:

Be assigned specifically under the MetaSys Logistics Organization first.

Be organization-aware (each org has separate hiring pipelines, documents, and HR flows).

Connect properly to existing HR module and expand its sections where missing.

Every action must trigger notifications (task assigned, document missing, probation due, etc.).

Relevant KPIs must show on Admin Dashboard: New Hires This Month, Pending Probation Reviews, Exit Rate, etc.

1. HIRING PIPELINE (NEW Submodule under HR > Hiring)
✅ Add a full “Hiring Tracker” view:

Table View per Job Role

Status columns: Applied → Screening → Interviewed → Offered → Onboarded
