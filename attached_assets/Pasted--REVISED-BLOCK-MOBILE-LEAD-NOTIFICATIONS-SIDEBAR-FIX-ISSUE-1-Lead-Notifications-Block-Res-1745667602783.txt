[REVISED BLOCK: MOBILE LEAD NOTIFICATIONS & SIDEBAR FIX]

üîµ ISSUE 1: Lead Notifications Block (Responsive + Mobile View)

Problem:
On mobile, the Lead Notifications panel is broken:

Tabs are overlapping and unreadable

Buttons/text overflows outside the container

No wrapping, no scrolling

Terrible UX on small screens (<768px)


Fix Instructions (Updated):

‚úÖ Make the Lead Notifications tabs horizontally scrollable on mobile.

Implement overflow-x-auto on the tab container.

Wrap the tabs in a <div class="flex-nowrap overflow-x-auto">.

Allow user to scroll sideways to see all tabs (Assigned Leads / Follow-Up / Inactive / Status Changes / Remarks).

Apply mobile-specific classes (sm:, md: breakpoints in Tailwind).


‚úÖ Additional mobile styling:

Set minimum width for each tab: min-width: 120px to prevent text cramping

Add margin between tabs (mr-2 or gap-2)

Ensure text inside each tab is center aligned vertically and horizontally.


‚úÖ Make the Lead Notification container itself:

Width: 95% of screen width

Center aligned

Padding inside the box to avoid cramping

Tabs should NEVER wrap into multiple lines. Keep them single row with horizontal scrolling.


‚úÖ Font sizes:

Set font size of tab labels to text-sm at mobile breakpoint.

Keep ‚ÄúLead Notifications‚Äù heading slightly smaller (e.g., text-lg on mobile).


‚úÖ Ensure vertical padding so that nothing is crammed near the top or bottom edges.

‚úÖ Visually test for iPhone 12, iPhone SE, Samsung S22 sizes.

üîµ ISSUE 2: Lead Notifications Block (Wrong Locations)

(Already described before, but reminder)

‚úÖ This block should ONLY appear on Dashboards.

/dashboard

/dispatch/dashboard

/sales/dashboard (future)


‚úÖ Do NOT render Lead Notifications block on:

CRM pages

Dispatch pages (loads, clients)

Finance, HR, Settings, Admin Management

Profile management

Reports

Anywhere else


‚úÖ Must conditionally render based on page route.

üîµ ISSUE 3: Sidebar Auto-Collapse on Mobile

(Already described before, but reminder)

‚úÖ Sidebar behavior on mobile:

After clicking on any module, sidebar should auto-collapse.

Close sidebar on menu item click.


‚úÖ If user opens sidebar manually via hamburger, it should open normally again.

‚úÖ Sidebar should use smooth transitions (width collapse, opacity fadeout) for better UX.

‚úÖ Test on screens <768px and touch devices.


---

‚úÖ FINAL EXPECTED OUTCOME (AFTER FIX)

‚úÖ On Mobile:

Lead Notifications look clean, neat, scrollable horizontally.

No broken overlap, no squeezed tabs.

Sidebar collapses automatically after choosing a menu item.

Lead Notifications panel only appears on dashboards.


‚úÖ On Desktop:

Normal sidebar behavior.

Normal Lead Notifications view ‚Äî no unnecessary scrolling on large screens.
