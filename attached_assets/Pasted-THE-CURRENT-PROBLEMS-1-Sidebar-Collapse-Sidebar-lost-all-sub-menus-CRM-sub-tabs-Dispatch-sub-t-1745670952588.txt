THE CURRENT PROBLEMS

1. Sidebar Collapse:

Sidebar lost all sub-menus (CRM sub-tabs, Dispatch sub-tabs).

Shows only top-level links like "Sales" and "Dispatch" with no children.

Behavior looks like a very old version from 2 months ago.



2. Lead Notifications Panel:

First deleted completely.

Now partially restored but behaving incorrectly.

Debug mode shows weird debugging text ("Dashboard: Yes, Excluded: No") instead of a real usable notification panel.

No notifications loading, broken route handling.



3. Routing and Permissions Broken:

Dispatch module page is broken or reset.

Dashboards are confused across user roles (Admin vs Team member).

Wrong module loading based on team/organization.



4. Mobile Responsiveness Issues:

Lead Notification Panel breaking UI on mobile.

Sidebar doesn't collapse properly after selection (UX broken).



5. Lost History:

Lost schema/database tracking of Leads, CRM structure, Dispatch leads syncing, etc.

Previous sub-modules and workflows (like “All Leads”, “SQL”, “MQL”, “Clients”, “Loads”, “Clients”, “New Load”) missing or reset.

WHAT HAPPENED?

> Replit bot deleted a lot of frontend and backend parts while trying to "fix" only visibility of the Lead Notification panel.
Instead of just hiding or restricting the component properly (conditional rendering), it likely removed other critical codepaths, leading to rollback to older builds.




---

NOW HOW TO FIX THIS:

We DO NOT start from scratch.

We rebuild the structure properly based on the original plan.

And step-by-step restore things in a connected way.

Here’s the correct prompt you should copy-paste to Replit now to bring the platform back under control:

[EMERGENCY ROLLBACK & REPAIR INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPLIT BOT]


---

Part 1: Overall Objective

✅ Restore the MetaSys ERP structure, features, and modules exactly as outlined below.
✅ Do NOT delete existing files unless explicitly instructed.
✅ Always connect features correctly — frontend, backend, database schema, real-time sync.


---

Part 2: Sidebar Structure

Fully Restore the Sidebar structure based on organization & permissions:

✅ Dropdowns must expand/collapse on click (Mobile and Desktop).

✅ After selection, sidebar collapses automatically on Mobile.

✅ Sticky sidebar toggle functionality must work cleanly.


---

Part 3: Lead Notifications Panel

✅ Restore the Lead Notifications properly:

Visible only on:

Admin Dashboard (for Admin)

User Dashboards (for Sales & Dispatch users)

Dispatch Main Module (Landing page)


NOT visible inside:

CRM views

Dispatch sub-views (like Loads, Clients individually)

Finance

HR

Settings



✅ Responsive on Mobile:

Tabs wrap inside scrollable view on small screens.

Tabs shrink text size slightly on Mobile.


✅ No debugging text ("Dashboard: Yes/Excluded: No") visible in production.

✅ Show real live Notifications based on the lead statuses.

✅ Notification panel connects properly to backend data (Leads, Loads, Dispatch Clients).


---

Part 4: Routing and Organization Control

✅ Based on Organization selection:

MetaSys Logistics users should land on Dispatch module and relevant views.

Sales organization users should land on CRM module dashboards.

Admin users can view both structures.


✅ Correct access controls based on role and team.

✅ If no valid team or organization exists — show fallback "No Organization Found" friendly page.


---

Part 5: Mobile UX Fixes

✅ When clicking a link in Sidebar on Mobile:

Sidebar collapses automatically.

New page loads correctly.


✅ If clicking outside Sidebar area on Mobile:

Sidebar collapses automatically.


✅ Smooth transitions, no sudden jump/glitch.

✅ Toggle buttons (Switches) throughout platform:

Must have clear On/Off state.

Proper contrast colors applied (Use MetaSys branding colors).



---

Part 6: Data & Schema Restorations

✅ Ensure database tables exist and work:

crm_leads

dispatch_clients

dispatch_loads

users

organizations

tasks

invoices

commissions

notifications


✅ No missing tables causing backend crashes (404, Null errors).

✅ Test database linkages end-to-end:

Create Lead

Move to Dispatch

Book Load

Generate Invoice

Assign Task

Notify Admin


✅ All user flows must not crash.


---

[VERY IMPORTANT]

✅ Do NOT delete existing working modules/features.

✅ Only restore, fix, and connect broken or missing parts.

✅ Follow modular architecture:

Backend ➔ Database ➔ Frontend ➔ Realtime ➔ Notifications


✅ After every major change — TEST the system before pushing live.


---

✅ Final Acceptance:

✅ Full functional dashboards
✅ Fully working CRM + Dispatch modules
✅ Lead Notifications stable and visible only where needed
✅ Sidebar functional and Mobile friendly
✅ Organization and Permissions working properly
✅ No missing tables or schema
✅ No errors in console (Frontend or Backend)
