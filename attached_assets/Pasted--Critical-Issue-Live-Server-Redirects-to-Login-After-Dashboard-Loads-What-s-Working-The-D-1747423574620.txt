🛑 Critical Issue: Live Server Redirects to Login After Dashboard Loads
✅ What’s Working:
	• The Dev Server works fine:
		○ Login screen shows
		○ Auth works
		○ Dashboard loads and stays accessible
		○ Navigation across modules works
❌ What’s Broken:
	• The Live Server (erp.metasysltd.com) logs in but:
		○ Immediately loads the dashboard
		○ Then auto-redirects back to the login screen
		○ This creates an infinite loop or "bounce-back" pattern

🔍 What’s Likely Going Wrong (You don’t need to debug this—Replit does)
This usually happens when:
	• The auth token or session is set properly on the Dev server, but not on the Live server
	• Live environment doesn’t:
		○ Store cookies/session correctly
		○ Handle Secure/SameSite cookie flags properly
		○ Send the session on GET /api/auth/me
	• OR the AuthProvider (on the frontend) gets a 401 or empty user object and forces redirect to /login

📣 Message to Replit
	The Dev server is now working properly, but the live deployed version is still broken.
	Here’s the problem:
		○ After logging in, it shows the dashboard for a second
		○ Then automatically redirects back to /login
		○ This happens every time—even after successful login
	✅ Expected: Once I log in, I should stay on the dashboard unless I log out.
	❌ Actual: It bounces back to login even with valid credentials.
	Please check the following in the Live environment (not Dev):
		1. Does the session/cookie persist correctly in production?
		2. Is /api/auth/me returning a valid user on the live domain?
		3. Is there any mismatch in frontend session handling or routing logic between Dev and Live?
	Also verify:
		○ Cookie flags: SameSite=None; Secure
		○ That useEffect or router.push('/login') isn’t firing too early if auth is undefined or null
	Do not change the flow or structure.
	Just ensure the session persists and the user doesn’t get kicked out.
	If you need to apply a fix, please test and confirm it works on both Dev and Live before closing it.
