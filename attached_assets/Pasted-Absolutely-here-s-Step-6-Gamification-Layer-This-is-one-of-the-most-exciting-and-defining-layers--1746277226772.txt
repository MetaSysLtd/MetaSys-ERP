STEP 6: Gamification & Motivation Layer


---

Vision Summary

> MetaSys ERP is not just a system — it's a performance coach.

This layer introduces role-specific goals, weekly leaderboards, and achievement badges that drive motivation, accountability, and culture.



The system now measures, rewards, and reminds users of their value — in a friendly, non-toxic, and data-backed way.

Core Modules in the Gamification Layer


---

1. Scorecards (User Performance Overview)

Display Format:

Show this as a dashboard card widget

Auto-refreshes every login or every Monday

Includes goal (e.g. “Your target = 5 leads/week”)



---

2. Leaderboards (Team Rankings)

Access Rules:

Users see only their own team

Admin sees all roles



---

3. Achievement Badges

Display:

Show badge on profile card

Optional: Slack/Team alert when new badge unlocked

Logic should run every Sunday night (cron job or backend)



---

4. Weekly Goal Tracker Widget

Every Monday, show a soft alert on user dashboard:

> “Your goal this week is 5 leads. Last week you achieved 3.”



Progress circle shows % completion
Clicking it opens full scorecard


---

5. Shoutouts / Recognition Wall


---

Gamification Design Notes

Stick to MetaSys brand colors:

Primary: #025E73

Accent: #F2A71B, #412754


Keep widgets light, fast, and non-blocking

Avoid dark patterns — no toxic competition

Always show own progress first, then team comparisons

Final Vision Description for Replit Agent

> We’re now adding the Gamification Layer to MetaSys ERP.

This includes Scorecards, Leaderboards, and Badges — all fed by data from CRM, Dispatch, and Invoices.

The goal is visibility and motivation — not pressure.

Use dummy data if needed — get the UI and widgets in place first.

Start with:

Scorecard card on Dashboard

Leaderboard toggle

“Your Weekly Goal” widget

Simple badges logic (e.g., 5 leads = award)


Use light, animated UI — consistent with branding — and don’t over-engineer it.
Make it reusable, dynamic, and fun to look at.
