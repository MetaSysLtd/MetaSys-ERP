Looking at the admin dashboard screenshot, I can identify several UI/UX issues that are causing the "odd" appearance and responsiveness problems:

Core Issues Identified:
1. Inconsistent Card Sizing & Content Density
Cards have varying heights due to inconsistent content structure
Some cards have 2-line descriptions, others have 3-4 lines
The "Active Clients" card has excessive text ("Dispatch clients in date range") that breaks the visual rhythm
Card widths appear to be equal but content doesn't fill the space proportionally
2. Poor Typography Hierarchy
Main numbers (0, $0.00) are too small for dashboard KPIs
Secondary text is competing for attention with primary metrics
The "0% profit margin" red text creates visual chaos
Font weights and sizes lack clear hierarchy
3. Responsive Grid Issues
5-column layout on desktop will break poorly on smaller screens
Cards will likely stack awkwardly on mobile
No clear breakpoint strategy for different screen sizes
4. Visual Weight Imbalance
Icons are too small and don't provide enough visual anchor
Card borders are thin and don't create sufficient separation
Color usage is inconsistent (red profit margin stands out negatively)
Advanced Reasoning & Solutions:
Grid & Layout Improvements:
/* Implement responsive grid with better breakpoints */
.dashboard-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr));
  gap: 1.5rem;
  max-width: 100%;
}
@media (min-width: 1400px) {
  .dashboard-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr);
  }
}
@media (max-width: 1200px) {
  .dashboard-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  }
}
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .dashboard-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  }
}
Typography Scale Enhancement:
/* Establish clear hierarchy */
.metric-primary {
  font-size: 2.5rem; /* Much larger for main numbers */
  font-weight: 700;
  line-height: 1.2;
}
.metric-secondary {
  font-size: 0.875rem;
  font-weight: 500;
  color: #6B7280;
}
.metric-label {
  font-size: 1rem;
  font-weight: 600;
  margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
}
Card Design System:
.dashboard-card {
  min-height: 160px; /* Consistent height */
  padding: 1.5rem;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
.card-content {
  flex: 1;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
}
.card-icon {
  width: 2.5rem; /* Larger icons */
  height: 2.5rem;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
Specific Recommendations:
1. Content Strategy:
Simplify card descriptions to single, concise lines
Standardize metric presentation (number + unit + context)
Remove redundant text like "Dispatch clients in date range"
2. Visual Hierarchy:
Increase primary number size to 36-40px
Reduce secondary text to 14px
Use consistent icon sizes (40px)
Implement better color coding (avoid red for neutral metrics)
3. Responsive Design:
Implement CSS Grid with auto-fit and minmax()
Use container queries for card-level responsiveness
Design mobile-first with progressive enhancement
4. Data Presentation:
Group related metrics (Sales vs Dispatch vs Finance)
Use progressive disclosure (summary â†’ details)
Implement loading states for better perceived performance
5. Component Architecture:
Looking at your SystemHealth.tsx component, you already have good patterns like:

Tabbed interfaces for complex data
Consistent badge usage
Proper loading states
Apply these same patterns to the main dashboard cards for consistency.

The key is to treat this as a design system problem rather than just a styling issue. Each card should follow the same content template, visual hierarchy, and responsive behavior patterns.
