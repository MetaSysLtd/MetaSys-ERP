1. Toggle Buttons — Visibility, Contrast, Branding
Issue:
The toggle buttons (like for Dark Mode, Notification settings, Slack alerts, etc.) are currently barely visible. No clear On/Off state.

Instruction:

When On, toggle button background must be bright brand Yellow #F2A71B, knob white.

When Off, background must be white, but with a border color of brand Navy #011F26.

The knob (circle) must always have a 2px contrast border.

Animation:

Smooth sliding animation (100ms) when toggled.

Slight shadow around active state.

Apply across: All toggles platform-wide (in Settings, Profile, Notifications, Admin).

2. Ability to Add More System Administrators
Current Gap:
Only one "Super Admin" exists (you). Cannot delegate admin powers partially.

Instruction:

Under User Management > Roles, add System Admin as a role selectable.

When assigning System Admin:

Allow assigning granular permissions (checkboxes): Manage Users, View Finance, Manage HR, Approve Reports, etc.

Only you (current Super Admin) can promote someone to System Admin.

Display System Admins separately in Admin Dashboard > Org Users Overview.

Backend Changes:
Extend role: "admin" | "systemAdmin" | ... in users collection.

3. Task Management — Full Assignment & Notification
Problem:
Tasks modules exist but aren’t truly working for user-to-user assignment or notification flow.

Instruction:

Allow any user with permission canAssignTasks (typically TLs, Managers, Admins) to:

Create a task

Assign it to another user (single select)

When assigned:

Automatically generate a Notification inside platform (Bell Icon)

Notification Title: “New Task Assigned”

Notification Body: “You have been assigned a task: {taskTitle}”

Task should show under /tasks page filtered as “Assigned to Me”

Assigned user should also get Slack DM if Slack integration is on.

Task status:

Open → In Progress → Done → Cancelled

Dashboard Linkage:

Admin Dashboard > New widget → "Tasks Overview":
(Open Tasks Today, Tasks Completed Today, Overdue Tasks)

Backend Needed:

Task ownership (assignedToId) field

Task status update endpoints

Notification socket event: taskAssigned

4. Company HR Policies & Document Repository (NEW Feature)
Problem:
There is no common place where company policies and HR documents can be uploaded, stored, and accessed role-based.

Instruction:

Create a new sub-tab under Human Resources sidebar called Company Policies.

This page will:

List all uploaded documents (PDF, DOCX, etc.)

Have metadata per document: Title, Description, Created At, Uploaded By

Filter by Audience: "All Staff", "Dispatch Only", "Sales Only", "Management Only", etc.

Upload Functionality:

Only users with permission canManagePolicies (HR Manager, System Admin) can upload/edit/delete.

Access Functionality:

Regular employees can only view/download based on team/department match.

UI/UX:

White cards listing documents.

Icon (PDF / DOCX) and download button.

Filters on top: Audience selector (All, Dispatch, Sales, etc.)

Backend Schema:

ts
Copy
Edit
company_policies {
  _id,
  title,
  description,
  fileUrl,
  audience: ["all", "sales", "dispatch", "hr", "finance", "marketing"],
  createdBy,
  createdAt
}
Notifications:

When new policy is uploaded → Notify relevant users inside platform + optional Slack alert.

Important Global Notes
Every Action: (task assigned, lead updated, policy uploaded, etc.) must trigger corresponding Notification inside platform.

Every Notification: must be color-coded:

Success = Green

Info = Blue

Warning = Yellow

Danger = Red

All user actions must respect RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) you already implemented. No leaks.

Final Return
Return PASS only when:

Toggles fixed across platform

Multiple System Admins creation works

Task assignment with notification works

HR Company Policies module working with document upload/download

Related actions reflect on Admin Dashboard KPIs
