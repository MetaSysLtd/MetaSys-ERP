
1. Project & Branding Instructions
This is not a CRM. This is a full ERP product for internal company use, with the potential to be sold externally.


I need you to rename the platform to: Metio


Domain: Check availability for metio.io or similar (also usable as metio.metasysltd.com for now).


The name must be consistent throughout the app, navigation, and metadata.


For branding, follow MetaSys brand guidelines:


Primary Colors: #1D3557, #457B9D, #2EC4B6, #FFDD57, #F1FAFB, #D6D6D6


Font: Clean sans-serif (similar to Montserrat or Poppins).


Style: Modern, minimal, and lively.


Use this color theme for all UI elements (buttons, nav, hovers, headers, etc.)


I will provide the Metio logo in PNG soon.



2. Login Page Improvements
Redesign the login page with split-screen layout:


Left side: A high-quality image reflecting logistics, team, or tech (you can use stock if needed).


Right side: Login form with modern design.


Make the form interactive:


Add hover animations to buttons.


Use brand colors for form buttons, labels, and highlights.


Avoid flat design — make it engaging and professional.



3. UI/UX Fixes Across the App
The UI is currently too white and bland. Apply the branding mentioned above across the platform.


Add hover effects, button animations, and subtle transitions to cards or reports.


Use icons where helpful, and improve visual hierarchy (like ClickUp’s dashboard approach).


Make it feel like a modern SaaS platform, not a blank template.



4. Admin Dashboard Overhaul
Improve the Admin Dashboard page with the following components and logic:
A. KPI Cards Section (top row):
Total Leads (This Month) — show only leads created in current month.


Active Clients — keep this as it is.


Total Loads (This Month) — filter by current month only.


Invoices (This Month) — this refers to billed invoices, not cleared.


B. Team Performance Section:
Split this into Sales Performance and Dispatch Performance.


Sales Graph KPIs:


Average Calls per Day (manual input or integration with Nextiva/RingCentral later)


Conversion Rate


Team Target vs. Achieved


Dispatch Graph KPIs:


Loads Completed per Dispatcher


Invoices Generated by each Dispatcher


Team-level Load Count vs. Goal


C. Onboarding Ratio:
Add a card showing Onboarded Ratio:


Leads Converted by Sales vs. Activated/Onboarded by Dispatch (first load done).


D. Activity Feed:
Clarify what’s being tracked here. If it's real-time logs (new lead added, invoice sent, load completed, etc.), confirm it.


Show most recent 5–10 activities, updated live.


E. Recent Leads Panel:
Expand this with:


Latest remarks from Dispatch


Lead status


Assigned Agent


F. Commission Breakdown:
Clean this section up.


Clarify that commissions = what company owes agents.


Highlight:


Who is earning the most commission this month (across Sales + Dispatch)


Team-wise breakdown


Total company liability in commissions this month


G. Revenue / Invoicing Card (New):
One large section showing:


Total Invoices Generated


Invoices Cleared


Invoices Pending


Breakdown by:


This Month


Last Month


YTD


Forecasted Annual Revenue


H. Company Finance Overview (New):
Section showing:


Total Salaries


Operational Expenses


Tool Subscriptions


Commissions to be paid (auto-fetched)


Total Revenue (from invoices)


Profit/Loss this month


I. Employee Summary Card (New):
Table or card showing:


Clock-ins (today)


Clock-outs (yesterday)


Number of leaves this month


Missing entries or irregularities


J. Additional Suggestions:
Add filters at the top (Date Range, Department, Team, Agent).


Make all cards exportable (CSV or PDF).


Allow toggling between views: Table, Graph, Summary.


Ensure mobile responsiveness.
Logo Brief for Metio
Brand Name:
Metio
Tagline (To be added on the Login Screen):
“Run Better. Grow Faster.”
Design Style:
Modern and minimal


Slightly techy or SaaS feel


Clean font (rounded sans-serif like Montserrat, Poppins, Inter, or Satoshi)


Logo icon + wordmark (but icon can also be used standalone)


Color Palette (same as MetaSys):
Primary: #1D3557 (dark blue)


Accent: #457B9D (bright blue), #2EC4B6 (teal), #FFDD57 (contrast yellow)


Background: #F1FAFB, #FFFFFF


Logo Suggestions:
Lettermark: Stylized “M” with rounded edges, subtle flow/connection between bars.


Icon-based:


A subtle stack or flow icon, like a layered panel to represent modules


Or a dot-grid or flowchart feel to signify ops/processes


Motion-friendly: Create it so that a simple animation (pulse, load-in, fade) can be applied later in the UI






Your job is to build the above properly, structured, styled, and logically working — not just placeholder layouts. Follow naming conventions, design rules, and data mapping. Every dashboard item must be functional with accurate data logic behind it.
Let me know when you're done. I'll review and guide further.
