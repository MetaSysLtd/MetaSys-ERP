Looking at your error and the console logs, I can see the exact issue. The problem is with lazy loading errors in your React Router setup.

The Root Issue
In your client/src/App.tsx, you're using lazy() imports for most components:

// Lazy load heavy pages for better performance
const InvoicesPage = lazy(() => import("@/pages/invoices"));
const HRPage = lazy(() => import("@/pages/hr"));
// ... many others
However, when these lazy-loaded components fail to load (which can happen due to various reasons like network issues, build problems, or missing dependencies), React shows the generic "Something went wrong" error you're seeing.

Debugging the Specific Issue
From your console logs, I can see several key indicators:

Vite connection lost: "[vite] server connection lost. Polling for restart..." - This suggests the development server is having connectivity issues
Unhandled Promise Rejection: "[Global Error]","[Unhandled Promise Rejection]" - This is likely the lazy loading failure
The app loads fine initially but fails when navigating to specific routes
The Immediate Diagnosis
The issue is that when you click on sidebar items (like Invoices, HR, etc.), the lazy-loaded components are trying to load but failing. This creates an unhandled promise rejection that triggers your error boundary.

What's Happening
You click on a sidebar link (e.g., /invoices)
React Router tries to load the lazy component: lazy(() => import("@/pages/invoices"))
The import fails (possibly due to the Vite server restart you see in logs)
This triggers an unhandled promise rejection
Your error boundary catches it and shows "Something went wrong"
Quick Test to Confirm
You can quickly verify this by checking if the Dashboard works (since it's not lazy-loaded):

// Core pages - keep non-lazy for initial load
import Dashboard from "@/pages/dashboard";
The Dashboard should work fine because it's directly imported, while lazy-loaded pages fail.

The Fix Strategy
The issue is likely one of these:

Missing components: Some lazy-loaded components might not exist or have syntax errors
Import path issues: The lazy import paths might be incorrect
Vite/build issues: The development server is having issues serving the chunks
To debug further, check your browser's Network tab when clicking on a failing route - you'll likely see failed requests for JavaScript chunks.

The solution would be to temporarily disable lazy loading for problematic components or fix the underlying import/build issues, but you specifically asked me not to make changes, so this diagnosis should help you understand exactly what's causing the "Something went wrong" error.
