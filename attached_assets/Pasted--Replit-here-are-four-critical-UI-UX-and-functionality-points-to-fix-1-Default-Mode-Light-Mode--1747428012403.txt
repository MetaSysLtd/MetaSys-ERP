Replit, here are four critical UI/UX and functionality points to fix:
1. Default Mode (Light Mode)
	• Issue: The default mode is incorrectly set to Dark Mode for new users or incognito sessions.
	• Required Fix: Set the default mode explicitly to Light Mode for all new or incognito users. Dark Mode should only activate when users explicitly select it from the menu (user preference).
    - Whichever mode is selected by that particular user using the paltform, save it for that user to make it default or the selected mode and save it on the backend as preference so whenever they log back in, this is the default, unless they change it. 
2. Animation Default State (Off)
	• Issue: Animations are turned on by default, causing loading and rendering performance issues.
	• Required Fix: Set animation settings default to off for every user. Users should manually enable it only if desired, from their profile menu.
    - Whichever option is selected by that particular user using the paltform, save it for that user to make it default or the selected mode and save it on the backend as preference so whenever they log back in, this is the default, unless they change it. 
3. Settings Button (404 Error)
	• Issue: Clicking "Settings" in the user dropdown menu returns a 404 page.
	• Likely Cause: Routing or linking issue in the frontend router file.
	• Required Fix: Ensure the "Settings" option in the profile dropdown is properly linked and routed to the correct settings page. Check routing files (likely routes.tsx or App.tsx) to validate and correct this path.
4. Button UI Issues (Icon Spacing & Contrast)
	• Issue: Buttons across the platform show unexpected empty space on the left side and icons only on hover. Buttons’ colors and UI contrast are inconsistent with the brand guidelines.
	• Analysis:
		○ The hover state is showing icons hidden by default, causing strange spacing.
		○ Button color contrast isn't matching brand color (see the correct brand color used for "Sign In" button screenshot provided).
	• Required Fixes:
		○ Ensure icons in buttons either remain visible or eliminate the unnecessary gap if they are meant to be hidden.
		○ Match the exact brand button style already used on the Sign-In page across the entire platform (color: #025E73 and proper spacing).

Guidance for Execution:
	• Focus on consistency with the Sign-in button's color and style.
	• Avoid breaking existing functionality or animations permanently (just default them off).
	• Verify all routing explicitly in routes.tsx, App.tsx, or any router middleware handling pages or profile menus.
	• Cross-check the default dark-mode state handling in the AuthContext or local storage/state persistence methods to ensure correct initial state.
Implement these carefully to maintain existing features and enhance platform stability and visual consistency.
