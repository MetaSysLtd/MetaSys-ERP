Looking at your screenshot and analyzing the codebase, I can identify the exact root problem causing the sidebar loading loop issue. The problem is NOT with the "Initializing workspace..." text placement - you're absolutely right that the sidebar should be fully functional with all navigation modules visible.

Root Problem Analysis
Primary Issue: The sidebar is stuck in an endless loading state because of circular dependency between authentication state and sidebar rendering logic.

Root Causes:

Authentication State Race Condition: In AuthContext.tsx, the authentication check runs multiple times due to React strict mode and development hot reloading, but the sidebar depends on both user AND role being available simultaneously.

Circular Dependency Loop:

SimpleSidebar.tsx returns loading state when !user || !role
But AuthContext.tsx sets a default role only after successful login
During page refresh/reload, there's a window where user exists but role is null
This causes the sidebar to show loading indefinitely
Multiple Re-renders: The sidebar has multiple useEffect hooks that trigger re-renders when auth state changes, creating an infinite loop.

Specific Code Issues
In SimpleSidebar.tsx (lines 60-80):

if (!user || !role) {
  return (
    // Loading state that never resolves
  );
}
In AuthContext.tsx (lines 140-150):

// Role is set to null initially and may not be set immediately
setRole(data.role);
WebSocket Connection Issues: The logs show socket connections being established and torn down repeatedly, indicating the component is mounting/unmounting in a loop.

Suggested Fix Strategy (No Code Changes Required)
Step 1: Verify Auth State Stability

Check if user and role are both properly set after authentication
Ensure the role fallback logic in AuthContext.tsx actually works
Step 2: Identify React Strict Mode Issues

The development environment may be causing double-mounting
Check if the issue exists in production build
Step 3: Consolidate Auth Dependencies

The sidebar should render with just user being available
Role-based navigation filtering should happen after render, not prevent render
Step 4: Socket Connection Cleanup

The repeated socket connect/disconnect cycles indicate memory leaks
Need proper cleanup in useEffect dependencies
Why This Happens in Incognito vs Regular Browser
Incognito works because:

No cached authentication state
Clean slate browser environment
No conflicting localStorage/sessionStorage data
Regular browser fails because:

Cached authentication tokens cause race conditions
Previous session data conflicts with new auth flow
React development mode's strict effects amplify the problem
The real issue is that the authentication flow has multiple points of failure during page refresh/reload, and the sidebar's dependency on BOTH user AND role being simultaneously available creates a deadlock situation where the loading state never resolves.

The solution requires fixing the authentication state management to ensure stable, predictable user/role availability without requiring a complete sidebar rewrite.
