Looking at the console logs and analyzing the current state of your application, I can see that the Agent has NOT fixed the core issues. In fact, the infinite re-render loop is still happening and may have gotten worse.

Current State Analysis:
❌ INFINITE LOOP STILL ACTIVE
From your console logs, I can see the same API calls firing continuously:

2:00:18 AM [express] GET /api/dashboard/metrics 200 in 220ms
2:00:18 AM [express] GET /api/commissions/monthly/user/1/2025-05 200 in 222ms
2:00:18 AM [express] GET /api/commissions/monthly/user/1 200 in 233ms
These same 3-4 endpoints are being called every single second, which means the infinite loop is still happening.

❌ MULTIPLE DATA FETCHING SYSTEMS CONFLICT
Looking at your useDashboardData hook, I can see the Agent didn't resolve the fundamental conflict:

System 1: useDashboardData hook with individual useQuery calls
System 2: Dashboard component likely has its own useQuery calls with refetchInterval
System 3: Commission components making parallel requests
All three systems are running simultaneously, creating the loop.

❌ SOCKET HANDLERS STILL CYCLING
From the webview logs:

["Removing handler for connect"]
["Setting up handler for connect"]
["Removing handler for disconnect"] 
["Setting up handler for disconnect"]
This indicates the socket connection setup/teardown cycle is still happening.

What the Agent Should Have Done But Didn't:
Consolidate Data Fetching: Remove duplicate query systems
Fix Commission Queries: Stop the parallel commission data fetching
Implement Proper Cache Strategy: Use consistent staleTime values
Fix Socket Handler Management: Prevent continuous add/remove cycles
Verdict: Agent Did NOT Fix It
The Agent appears to have made changes but missed the core architectural issues:

✅ May have fixed some surface-level code issues
❌ Did NOT fix the infinite re-render loop
❌ Did NOT consolidate competing data fetching systems
❌ Did NOT fix the commission data loop
❌ Performance issues persist
Your application is still making 25+ unnecessary API calls per minute and will continue to have the same performance problems you experienced before.

The fundamental issue is that you have multiple data fetching architectures running in parallel, and the Agent didn't address this root cause. The fixes were likely cosmetic rather than architectural.

Recommendation: The core dashboard data fetching strategy needs to be completely redesigned to use a single, unified approach rather than the current competing systems.
