Here’s a structured breakdown of your message — cleaned up, productized, and ready to send to Replit as a complete feature request + logic flow. This includes backend, frontend, workflow, schema, and integration expectations:


---

Request for Replit: Time Tracking + Leaves Integration + HR Policy Controls

1. Time Tracking Status Check

Please confirm whether the Time Tracking module is fully functional:

Does it write to the database?

Does tracked time update relevant dashboard widgets and reports?

Is this data also being passed to the Human Resources module (if exists)?

Will this module contribute to performance tracking, employee records, and payroll?




---

2. Feature Request: Leave Management System (Standalone Module)

We now need a dedicated Leaves module, not embedded inside Time Tracking, with full workflow, permissions, and admin logic.

Module Placement:

Create "Leaves" as a separate module in the left sidebar.

Position it directly beneath Time Tracking.



---

3. Leave System Core Features

a. Leave Categories

Two leave types:

Casual/Medical Leave

Annual Leave


Each employee has a total of 16 annual leaves (8 + 8), reset automatically on 1st Jan every year.


b. Leave Request Workflow

Any employee can submit a leave request:

Pick leave type

Select date range

Add reason


System Admin + HR roles only can:

Approve or reject leave requests

Receive real-time notifications

Edit/delete past leave entries



c. Leave Quota Controls

HR/Admin can:

Set custom leave quotas per employee, team, or department

Override/reset individual balances

Manually add/remove leaves


These controls must sync with settings under Human Resources > Policies.



---

4. HR Policy Editor (New Sub-Module)

Location:

Under Human Resources, add a new sub-module:

Label: Policies or Leave & Time Rules

Can be part of an expanded HR > Settings structure if preferred



Functions in this sub-module:

Define leave policies (annual caps, reset date)

Define time tracking rules (expected hours, overtime logic, late penalty logic)

Assign policies per employee, department, or organization-wide

Control visibility and editing permissions



---

5. System-Wide Integration Requirements

Everything must work seamlessly across modules:

Feature	Connects With	Notes

Leave Requests	Notifications	Notify Admin + Team Lead on submission
Approved Leaves	Dashboard	Update team performance and availability reports
Leave History	HR Records	Log in employee profile for reviews
Leave Impact	Payroll (Future)	Reduce paid days from monthly calculation
Policy Changes	All Users	Take effect based on assignment logic (individual/team/org)



---

6. Additional UX/UI Expectations

Approval buttons (Accept/Reject) must appear for HR/Admin in notification panel.

Color-coded calendar to show upcoming leaves per team.

Progress bars or counters to show used vs. available leaves.

Exportable CSVs per employee.



---

Instructions Summary for Replit

> Please confirm that the Time Tracking module is fully connected on the backend and updates dashboard data.

We also need a new standalone Leaves module for managing employee time-off (Casual/Medical + Annual). This should be completely workflow-driven, include approval/rejection logic, support quota editing, and be permission-bound (only HR/Admin can edit).

Build an HR sub-module called "Policies" to manage leave quotas and time tracking rules at the employee, team, and org level. The logic should be reusable, similar to how Commission Policies are structured.

All leave activity should trigger notifications and feed into HR records and performance dashboards. No manual edits allowed by employees. System resets leave counters annually and supports granular control by HR/Admin.

Would you like me to break this into Jira-style tickets or turn this into a Notion product spec for team coordination?
