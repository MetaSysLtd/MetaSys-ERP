Perfect‚Äîhere‚Äôs how to guide Replit clearly and professionally from your Product Manager role:

**Replit, two critical backend-level issues to address immediately:**

---

### üî¥ 1. **Leads Not Actually Being Created**

* **Observed Behavior:**

  * When clicking **"Create Lead"**, the toast message says:

    > ‚ÄúLead Created Successfully‚Äù
  * However, no lead appears in the list (List/Kanban views).
  * No new entry is actually rendered in the UI or visible after refresh.

* **What this likely means:**

  * There is **no actual backend insertion logic** being triggered,
  * Or the data is not returning properly to the frontend via API or socket.

* **Action Needed:**

  1. Confirm the POST `/api/leads` route **exists** and is **active**.
  2. Verify it writes the lead into the database (`leads` collection/table).
  3. Ensure a socket event like `lead_created` is **emitted** and **handled** to update the UI in real time.
  4. If leads are saved correctly, **check if the frontend is calling GET `/api/leads`** to re-fetch after creation.

* **Suggested Area to Check:**

  * Backend: `server/routes/crm/leads.ts` or similar (for DB logic)
  * Frontend: `client/src/pages/crm/leads.tsx` for UI refresh & API handling

### üü† 2. **Multiple Auto-Refreshes During Login Flow (Live Server)**

* **Issue:**

  * After signing in, the live site visibly:

    * Loads the dashboard ‚Üí auto-refreshes ‚Üí flashes login ‚Üí back to dashboard.
  * This loop happens *before* the app settles in.

* **What this likely indicates:**

  * **Session or token persistence is unstable.**
  * **Auth state** is being checked multiple times before settling.
  * Possibly:

    * Redundant routing logic or client-side `useEffect()` loops
    * Re-triggered session validation
    * Slow backend validation (delayed user context load)

* **What to do:**

  * Trace **auth state hydration flow** after `signIn()`:

    1. When the user signs in, how is the session/token stored?
    2. Are any `useAuth()` or `AuthProvider` logic blocks re-running unintentionally?
    3. Is the frontend calling `/api/auth/me` or similar repeatedly?
  * Use logs or debug console to inspect **which calls are being made in rapid succession** after login.

### ‚úÖ Summary of Request to Replit:

* Leads:

  * Confirm backend logic is fully implemented for **lead creation**, **persistence**, and **UI population**.
  * Review DB insertion, response, and socket broadcast.

* Login Flow:

  * Identify and eliminate **redundant auth checks or re-renders**.
  * Optimize login-to-dashboard routing so it doesn‚Äôt bounce between pages or revalidate multiple times.

Let me know once it‚Äôs stabilized. I‚Äôll recheck all workflows.
