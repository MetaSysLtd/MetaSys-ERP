Alright—here’s a concise, high-level spec you can hand off to Replit (or any front-ender) without diving into code. Treat this as your “ticket” list with clear objectives, flows, and acceptance criteria:

---

## 1. **Global Button & Interaction States**

**Problem:**
Some buttons (e.g. “Sign In,” “Update Metrics,” sidebar toggles) flicker to yellow on click, others don’t. Users can’t build muscle memory.

**What to Deliver:**

* **Single source of truth** for all clickable controls: primary, secondary, tertiary.
* **Hover / active / focus** states must use our brand palette:

  * Primary: `#025E73` → `#011F26` (hover) → `#412754` (active)
  * Secondary: `#F2A71B` → darker/tinted hover → alternate active
* **Consistent focus rings** for keyboard users (Inter font, rounded corners).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Every button or “button-like” link in the app shows the same hover/active/focus transition.
* Verify on Desktop & mobile widths in Chrome with 100% zoom.

## 2. **Sidebar Navigation Feedback**

**Problem:**
Deep links (CRM → Leads/Accounts/Clients/etc.) only get a faint 2 px left border. Hard to see, no background change.

**What to Deliver:**

* Wrap all sidebar items—including nested—into a nav component that uses React Router’s “active” state.
* **Active item styling**:

  * Visible background highlight (very light amber)
  * 4 px left border in brand yellow (`#F2A71B`)
  * Text switches to primary teal (`#025E73`) and bold.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* When you click “Leads” under CRM, the entire row is highlighted and the parent “CRM” stays expanded.
* Hover on any item shows a subtle gray background.

## 3. **Login/Logout Flow & Redirects**

**Problem:**

* After logout you land back on Dashboard, not the login page.
* Unauthenticated users (and fresh tabs) go straight to `/dashboard` instead of `/login`.

**What to Deliver:**

* **Protect every route**: if no valid session → redirect to `/login`.
* **Logout handler**: clear session + force-redirect to `/login`.
* **Initial load**: app entry point must check session first, then push to login or dashboard.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Open in a private/incognito window → you always see the login screen.
* On successful logout → user sees login form (no Dashboard flash).
* No “flash of content” showing dashboard to unauthorized.

## 4. **Performance & Perceived Speed**

**Problem:**
Sign-in → Dashboard load takes several seconds; blank spinners feel unresponsive.

**What to Deliver:**

* **Skeleton UIs**: show lightweight placeholders for header + menu so the frame feels instant.
* **Parallelize** critical calls: fetch user profile + permissions + key dashboard stats in one go.
* **Timeout fallbacks**: if a widget takes >1s, show its own “no data” state rather than freezing the whole page.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Header + sidebar appear within 300 ms of login click.
* Primary KPI cards render within 1 s; lower-tier widgets can lazy-load.
* No full-page blank screen longer than 500 ms.

## 5. **UX Consistency & Accessibility**

**Problem:**

* Some buttons/links are inconsistent.
* Screen reader & keyboard nav gaps.
* No clear focus outline on form fields and menu items.

**What to Deliver:**

* **ARIA labels** & `tabindex` where needed.
* **Uniform input styles**: single border, single shadow, clear focus ring.
* **Dark mode check**: verify colors invert properly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Keyboard‐only navigation lands on every interactive element in a logical order.
* Form inputs and buttons show visible focus rings.
* Contrast ratios meet WCAG AA.

### Next Steps

1. **Assign** each of the above to a sprint ticket.
2. **Review** on staging (dev) with shared incognito link.
3. **QA pass**: ride along in Chrome/Firefox, desktop & mobile.
4. **Deploy** to production.

Once these are in place, every click, hover, route‐guard and redirect will feel intentional, on‐brand, and rock-solid. Let me know when you’ve got a working staging build and we’ll verify each acceptance criterion together.
