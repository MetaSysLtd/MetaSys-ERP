Daily Dispatch Report Automation – Instructions for Replit AI Bot
GOAL
You must automate the full Dispatch Daily Tasks & Report into the ERP.

The system must:

Auto-generate the report daily (evening, based on time-zone)

Fetch live data from Loads, Leads, and Invoices modules

Calculate targets, achievements, pending follow-ups

Break it down per dispatcher

Send the finalized report automatically to Slack channel(s)

1. DATABASE STRUCTURE
✅ No need for new collections if loads, invoices, and dispatch_clients exist.

But you must aggregate across:

loads

invoices

pendingInvoices

activeLeads

2. WHAT THE DAILY REPORT MUST INCLUDE (PER DISPATCHER)
Target Invoice (today) → pre-set per dispatcher (default $400; editable later)

Generated Invoice (today) → sum of invoices today

Biggest Invoice of the day → highest single invoice booked today

Today Active Leads → number of active clients handled today

Today Loads Booked → total loads booked today

Cleared Invoices (today) → invoices marked "Paid" today

Pending Invoices → total outstanding $ linked to dispatcher

Invoice Follow-ups → list of carriers + pending amount

3. HOW TO FETCH/GENERATE
✅ For each dispatcher:

Query all loads booked createdAt: today

Query invoices createdAt: today and status: Paid

Sum invoiceValue where invoice.status = Paid

Sum invoiceValue where invoice.status = Pending

Find single highest value load today

Match dispatcher-client assignments to properly attribute loads/invoices

Pull Carrier Statuses ("Need Load", "Booked", "Will Let Us Know") via remarks/status updates on dispatch_clients today.

4. FRONTEND (Admin/Team Lead Panel)
Dispatch > Reports tab

Daily tab

Table grouped by Dispatcher:

Name

Target Invoice

Generated Invoice

Today's Loads

Pending Invoice

Top Carrier with Pending Invoice (optional)

Status notes (can be manually updated later)

5. AUTOMATED SLACK NOTIFICATION
✅ At shift end (7:00pm local time), post a Slack message:

Example format:

MetaSys Dispatch Daily Report — 24 April 2025

Brandon

Target Invoice: $400

Generated Invoice: $154

Biggest Invoice: Sam $93

Today Active Leads: 3

Today Loads Booked: 0

Cleared Invoice Today: $0

Pending Invoice: $983

Follow-ups:
Eduardo — $408
Kevin — $276
Tylar — $87
Mannan — $51

Alan

Target Invoice: $100

Generated Invoice: $23

...etc

✅ Use Slack blocks layout for neat formatting.
✅ If no loads/invoices booked, show "0" clearly.

6. MISSING FUNCTIONALITIES TO BUILD FIRST (Pre-requisite!)
Before sending this report, the following must be fixed or built:

Load booking module must correctly link to dispatchers and carriers

Invoicing module must track createdBy or dispatcherId correctly

Status or comments against carriers/leads (e.g., "Need Load", "Booked") must be retrievable

Daily targets should be adjustable per dispatcher (simple admin UI page later)

7. SPECIAL CASES
No Data for Dispatcher? → still show them with 0’s instead of skipping them.

Multiple Loads or Invoices? → sum properly; only show highest invoice separately.

8. TEST CASES
✅ Insert test data:

3 dispatchers, 5 loads today, 3 invoices (2 pending, 1 paid)

✅ Expected output:

Correct sums

Correct attribution of carrier pending amounts

Correct Slack notification format

✅ Cypress Tests:

Simulate new load booking → check real-time report update

Close invoice → report shows updated cleared $ today

9. EXTENSION (FUTURE WORK)
Allow Manager override before sending Slack post (small approve button)

Automatically update KPIs and bonus eligibility (commission triggers)

FINAL RETURN
Return PASS when:

/api/reports/daily/dispatch endpoint returns correct structure

Slack notification sends properly

Admin panel > Dispatch Reports shows today's breakdown
