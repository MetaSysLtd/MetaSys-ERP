1. Objective

Establish a shared “UI component catalogue” so every screen feels like one product. This will:

* Guarantee consistent look, feel and behavior across the platform
* Speed up future feature builds by reusing pre-approved elements
* Simplify maintenance and onboarding of new developers

---

### 2. Key Deliverables

1. **Component Inventory**

   * A list of all reusable pieces we need (Buttons, Inputs, Cards, Modals, Status Badges, Tabs, Filters, Typography styles, etc.)
   * Defined variants for each (primary/secondary button; error/success badge; small/large input)

2. **Usage Guidelines**

   * Clear rules for when and how to use each component
   * Examples of placement and spacing (e.g. “always place a primary button flush-right in headers”)
   * Accessibility must-haves (keyboard focus, color contrast)

3. **Component Catalogue**

   * A living reference (a simple web page or document) showing each component in its states: default, hover, disabled, error
   * Linkable, so designers, PMs, and devs can review and approve

4. **Roll-Out Plan**

   * Prioritized list of screens/modules to refactor with the new components
   * A schedule: e.g., CRM Dashboard first, then Leads Kanban, then Leads List, etc.

### 3. Approach & Workflow

1. **Kick-off Workshop**

   * Gather product, design, QA and key devs
   * Finalize the component list and variants
   * Agree on acceptance criteria for “done”

2. **Design Mock-up & Approval**

   * Designers produce polished examples of each component, using our Phase 1 tokens
   * Product team reviews for clarity, consistency, and completeness
   * Sign-off before any dev work begins

3. **Development Integration**

   * Devs build each component in isolation (in a sandbox or story viewer)
   * Product team verifies behavior, states, and edge cases
   * Only after approval does the component get merged into the main app

4. **Incremental Screen Refactor**

   * Tackle one screen at a time using the approved components
   * QA validates against our style guide checklist (fonts, colors, spacing, shadows)
   * Monitor for regressions (visual or functional)

### 4. Success Criteria

* **Consistency:** 100% of CRM screens use only components from the library—no one-off styles.
* **Speed:** New feature UIs built 30% faster by reusing existing components.
* **Quality:** No high-severity UI bugs (misaligned elements, color mismatches) post-rollout.
* **Satisfaction:** Positive feedback from users/stakeholders on a polished, uniform experience.
