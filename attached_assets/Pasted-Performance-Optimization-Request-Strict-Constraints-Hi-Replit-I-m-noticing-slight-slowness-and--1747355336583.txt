Performance Optimization Request (Strict Constraints)
Hi Replit,
I’m noticing slight slowness and lag across the platform—especially during initial login, screen transitions, and dynamic dashboard rendering.
I’d like you to begin carefully optimizing overall platform performance. However, please follow these non-negotiable rules while doing so:

🔐 Guardrails (Do not violate these)
	1. DO NOT remove or alter:
		○ Any working feature, UI/UX behavior, functionality, animation, or gamification element (e.g., loading animations, socket-based real-time updates).
		○ Any design consistency, routes, or permission logic.
	2. DO NOT eliminate logic just to reduce load times. Optimizations must be invisible to the user.
	3. If you find any significant or structural change, you must get my confirmation before applying it.

✅ What You Can Do
	• Optimize API response times, frontend load order, and resource usage.
	• Check for:
		○ Unnecessary re-renders
		○ Duplicate network calls
		○ Heavy third-party libraries
		○ Blocking code on route transitions
		○ Large payloads not being paginated or lazy-loaded
	• Review and patch any obvious inefficiencies (but only if non-breaking).
	• Minify JS/CSS assets or remove dead imports, only if completely safe.

🔍 Proactive Review & QA
Please also:
	• Run a full QA pass across the platform and check internal logs, dev console, and browser warnings.
	• Flag any deprecated methods, logic errors, or UX bugs.
	• Share a list of any major risks or outdated implementations that may affect long-term performance.
If anything you find seems significant or has the potential to affect flow/UI/state, pause and confirm with me first before taking action.

📍End Goal
The platform should feel snappier, lighter, and more responsive—but with zero degradation to design, logic, or real-time behavior.
Let me know once you’ve reviewed the performance profile and logs, and please confirm if any adjustments were made and where.
Thanks.
