Based on my analysis of your codebase and the current application state, I've identified several critical issues and major bugs:

Critical Database Issues
Database Connection Failures: The console shows Control plane request failed and CONNECT_TIMEOUT errors, indicating the database is not properly connected
Missing Required Tables: All core tables are missing (users, roles, organizations, leads, tasks, notifications, messages, sessions)
Database Health Check Failing: The health check reports 0 tables and unknown database size
Authentication & Session Issues
Session Expired Loop: The logs show "Session expired, logging out..." followed by repeated authentication attempts
Socket Authentication Failures: "Cannot emit event, socket is not connected: authenticate" errors
Session Keepalive Problems: The session keepalive is triggering premature logouts
Real-time Functionality Broken
Socket Connection Issues: Multiple socket handlers being set up and torn down repeatedly
WebSocket Connection Failures: Socket events not being properly transmitted
Real-time Updates Not Working: Cards and widgets not updating in real-time as expected
Frontend UI Issues
Sidebar Loading State: Shows "Initializing workspace..." instead of proper sidebar modules
Infinite Loading Loops: Components stuck in loading states
Dashboard Widget Manager Missing: The dashboard customization feature is no longer accessible
Missing/Dormant Features
Dashboard Widget Customization: The add/remove widgets functionality is missing from the dashboard
Real-time Card Updates: Lead cards, revenue cards, and other widgets don't update automatically
Socket-based Notifications: Real-time notifications are not working
Scheduler Disabled: The automated task scheduler is completely disabled
API Route Issues
Route Conflicts: Multiple route files (routes.ts, routes-minimal.ts, routes-stable.ts) causing confusion
API Response Inconsistencies: Some endpoints returning different response formats
Error Handling: Database errors not being properly caught and handled
Error Handling Problems
Unhandled Promise Rejections: Multiple unhandled rejections in the console
Database Error Cascading: Database connection issues causing app-wide failures
Error Recovery: No proper fallback mechanisms when services fail
Major Code Issues
Multiple Auth Context Initializations: Auth context being initialized multiple times causing state conflicts
Socket Event Handler Leaks: Event handlers not being properly cleaned up
Memory Leaks: Intervals and timeouts not being cleared properly
Root Causes
Database Configuration: The primary issue is database connectivity - without a working database, the entire application fails
Session Management: Flawed session validation logic causing authentication loops
Real-time Architecture: Socket.IO implementation has fundamental issues with connection management
State Management: Frontend state not properly synchronized with backend changes
Impact Assessment
High Priority: Database connectivity, authentication loops, sidebar functionality
Medium Priority: Real-time updates, dashboard widgets, notification system
Low Priority: UI polish, error message improvements
The application is currently in a non-functional state primarily due to database connectivity issues. Once the database is properly connected and tables are created, many of the downstream issues should resolve, but the authentication and real-time systems will still need significant fixes.
