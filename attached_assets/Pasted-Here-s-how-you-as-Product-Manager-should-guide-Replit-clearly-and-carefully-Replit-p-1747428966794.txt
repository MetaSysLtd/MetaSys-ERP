Hereâ€™s how you (as Product Manager) should guide Replit clearly and carefully:

---

**Replit, please address the following critical issues and enhancements in the CRM > Leads module:**

---

### ðŸ”´ **1. Critical Bug: Lead Creation Fails**

* **Issue:** When clicking **"Create Lead"**, a red error shows:

  > `Failed to execute 'fetch' on 'Window': '/api/leads' is not a valid HTTP method.`

* **Likely Cause:**

  * The fetch or axios call may be malformedâ€”likely a `GET` or `HEAD` request is being made instead of a `POST`.
  * Or, a missing method declaration (`method: 'POST'`) or incorrect function signature may exist.

* **What to Fix:**

  * Ensure the **createLead function** in the frontend properly calls the **POST** route to `/api/leads` (or whatever the route is in your backend).
  * Check the **backend route definition** in `server/routes/leads.ts` or similar, and ensure it allows POST.
  * Review any centralized fetch wrapper or API utilityâ€”this may be misinterpreting the request method.

### ðŸŸ¡ **2. Improve: Truck Category Dropdown Options**

* **Current Field:** "Truck Category" has vague or incomplete options.
* **Required Fix:** Replace existing options with the simplified list below:

```text
Class 1 â€“ Small pickup/SUV (up to 6,000 lbs)
Class 2 â€“ Light commercial (6,001â€“10,000 lbs)
Class 3 â€“ Medium pickup/commercial van (10,001â€“14,000 lbs)
Class 4 â€“ Box truck/light dump (14,001â€“16,000 lbs)
Class 5 â€“ Larger box/dump (16,001â€“19,500 lbs)
Class 6 â€“ City delivery truck (19,501â€“26,000 lbs)
Class 7 â€“ Large dump/semi (26,001â€“33,000 lbs)
Class 8 â€“ Heavy-duty trucks (33,001+ lbs)
```

* **Where to Fix:** This dropdown is likely in `client/src/pages/crm/leads.tsx` or similar form component. Find the `TruckCategoryOptions` or equivalent.

---

### ðŸŸ¢ **3. Improve: Equipment Type Dropdown**

* **Current Field:** Limited options; needs more coverage of real dispatcher-used trucks.
* **Required Fix:** Add more relevant truck types:

```text
Dry Van
Reefer
Flatbed
Box Truck
Hotshot
RGN
Power Only
Step Deck
Lowboy
Other (with conditional text field to input custom type)
```

* **Additional Logic:**

  * When user selects **"Other"**, show a conditional input field for custom entry (e.g., `Custom Equipment Type`).
* **Where to Fix:** This is likely in the same leads form (CRM > Leads page). Enhance the logic and form state to support conditional rendering based on dropdown value.

---

**Caution:**

* Do not break existing CRM features.
* Maintain the socket event for lead creation (`emit("lead_created", data)`) so dashboards update in real-time.
* Ensure validations and role-based access control are preserved when modifying these forms.

Let me know when itâ€™s updated so I can run another QA cycle.
