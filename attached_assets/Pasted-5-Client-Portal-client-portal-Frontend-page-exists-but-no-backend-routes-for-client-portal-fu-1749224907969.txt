5. Client Portal
• /client-portal - Frontend page exists but no backend routes for client portal functionality
6. Gamification
• /gamification - Frontend page exists but no backend implementation
Pages Leading to 401s (Authentication Issues)
1. Protected Routes Without Proper Auth Middleware
• /admin/* routes when user doesn't have sufficient role level (requires level 4-5)
• /settings/commission-policies - Requires admin privileges but may not have proper auth checks
2. API Endpoints with Missing Auth
• /api/dashboard/consolidated - Referenced in logs but route doesn't exist in consolidated-routes.ts
• /api/organization/current vs /api/organizations/current - Inconsistent route naming causing 404s
Dead-End Features (Incomplete Implementation)
1. Notifications System
• Frontend makes calls to /api/notifications but backend implementation is partial
• Schema exists but table creation is missing according to project_inventory.json
2. Messages/Conversations
• Frontend repeatedly calls /api/messages/conversations (visible in logs)
• Backend route exists but likely returns empty data or errors
3. Tasks Management
• /tasks page exists in frontend
• Backend shows "tasks (schema exists but table missing)" - incomplete database setup
4. Time Clock Entries
• Time tracking functionality has schema but no table creation
• Frontend page exists but backend storage is incomplete
5. Commission Policies Settings
• Frontend page /settings/commission-policies exists
• Backend has some commission logic but policy management is incomplete
Specific Route Inconsistencies
1. Organization Routes Mismatch
• Frontend calls /api/organization/current (singular)
• Backend defines /api/organizations/current (plural)
• This causes 404s as seen in logs
2. UI Preferences Route Issues
• Frontend calls /api/ui-prefs/me
• Logs show "Failed to fetch UI preferences" errors
• Route exists but may have middleware issues
3. Auth Route Inconsistencies
• Some auth checks use /api/auth/me with timestamps
• Multiple redundant calls visible in logs suggesting frontend retry logic issues
Database Schema vs Implementation Gaps
Based on project_inventory.json, these features have schema but missing tables:
• Notifications - Schema exists, table missing
• Tasks - Schema exists, table missing
• Time Clock Entries - Schema exists, table missing
Root Causes
1. Frontend-Backend Route Mismatch - Many frontend pages make API calls to non-existent backend routes
2. Incomplete Database Migrations - Tables not created despite schema definitions
3. Missing Authentication Middleware - Some routes lack proper role-based access control
4. Inconsistent Route Naming - Singular vs plural route naming causing 404s
5. Partial Feature Implementation - Frontend UI exists but backend logic incomplete
These issues explain why users may encounter 404s when navigating to certain pages or 401s when trying to access restricted functionality without proper permissions.
