Perfect — let’s move to Step 5: Invoices Module
This is where all the financial logic starts coming together.

STEP 5: Invoice System Setup


---

Overview

The Invoices Module connects Dispatch (loads booked) with Finance (revenue tracking).
It helps dispatchers, admins, and finance teams see what’s earned, what’s pending, and what’s been paid.

This module will also feed into dashboards, scorecards, and future accounting workflows.

Core Goals of Step 5


---

Key Pages to be Built or Fixed

1. /invoices

Table of all invoices (default: latest first)

Columns: Invoice ID, Client, Date, Amount, Status, Created By

Filter bar: by Dispatcher, Date Range, Status



2. Invoice Detail Page

Shows: Load info, Client, Dispatcher, Line Items, Totals

Buttons: Export PDF, Mark as Paid, Edit (Admin only)

Notes field for finance comments



3. Manual Invoice Creation Page (Optional)

Fields: Client, Amount, Notes, Dispatcher (if commission relevant)

Use this for bonuses, one-off billing not linked to a load

Important Logic & Conditions

Branding & UI Notes

Use MetaSys primary blue (#025E73) and accent yellow (#F2A71B) on headers, buttons

Keep table consistent with CRM/Dispatch views

PDF layout should match brand doc styling (e.g. logo top-left, table in center)

Add “Send Invoice” or “Mark Paid” buttons with proper access controls (Admin only)

Common Bugs to Prevent

How This Connects to Other Systems

Dispatch: Invoices are generated from loads booked

Finance: Amounts feed into reports, KPIs, profit margins

HR: Commissions paid later via Payroll (if implemented)

Scorecards: Weekly bonuses shown on dashboard

Gamification: Badges like “$5000+ Invoiced”

Notifications: Triggers alert on invoice sent/paid

Final Vision Description for Replit Agent (Human-style)

> We’re now building the Invoices Module — the financial heartbeat of MetaSys ERP.

Think of it as a record of all value booked and earned. It pulls data from Dispatch (loads) and feeds into Finance (revenue + commissions).

Focus areas:

Create Invoice table + detail view

Connect with loads when marked Delivered

Add basic filters, manual creation

PDF generation with clean branding

Commission sync when marked Paid


Use dummy data if APIs fail — but get the UI/flow 100% working.

Don’t break other modules. Reuse the same table + card UI where possible.
Branding matters here — PDF needs to look professional.
