It looks like after you sign in the app never finishes your “me” check and stays stuck in Loading/Redirecting. That means your auth-check endpoint or the client’s handling of it is never resolving successfully. Let’s give Replit a precise to-do list:

---

## 🚨 Symptom

* After login, you see persistent “Loading user data…” on the left and “Redirecting…” on the right.
* Your Dashboard never renders.

---

## 🕵️ What to Check & Fix

1. **Auth “/me” Endpoint**

   * **Verify** the backend route (e.g. `GET /api/auth/me`) actually returns status 200 and JSON `{ user: { … } }` when a valid session exists.
   * **Check** your server logs to confirm the request arrives and doesn’t error out or hang.

2. **Session Cookie / Token Transmission**

   * **In Browser DevTools → Network**, find the `/api/auth/me` request:

     * Confirm the session cookie (or `Authorization` header) is being sent.
     * If not, fix your client’s `fetch` or Axios call to include credentials (e.g. `fetch('/api/auth/me', { credentials: 'include' })`).

3. **Client Auth Hook**

   * **Ensure** the hook that calls `/me` resolves its Promise.
   * It should set `user` on success **and** clear `loading` so the spinner disappears.

4. **ProtectedRoute / Redirect Logic**

   * **Do not** redirect while the auth check is in progress.
   * Only redirect to `/login` when:

     * loading is **false**, **and**
     * `user === null`.

5. **Timeouts & Error Handling**

   * If `/me` returns 401, catch it and send the user back to `/login`.
   * If `/me` takes too long (>5s), show an error message like “Unable to load your session — please try refreshing.”

## 🎯 Ask for Replit

> **Hey team, the post-login “/me” check is never completing**—it’s stalling the client in a loading state forever. Please:
>
> 1. **Fix** the `/api/auth/me` route so it always returns a response (200 or 401) and never hangs.
> 2. **Ensure** the session cookie (or token) is properly set on login and sent on `/me`.
> 3. **Update** the client’s auth hook to:
>
>    * Include credentials in the request.
>    * Properly catch errors and stop the loading spinner.
> 4. **Adjust** your ProtectedRoute logic to wait for auth loading to finish before redirecting.
> 5. **Add** a 5s timeout fallback for the `/me` call to display a friendly “Session load timeout” error.

Once those changes are in, you should progress past “Loading user data…” into the Dashboard. Let me know when it’s resolved or if you need more details on any step!
