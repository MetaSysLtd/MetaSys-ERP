[URGENT FIX] – Lead Notifications Panel Visibility (Do NOT Remove, Restrict Correctly)


---

Context:
The Lead Notifications component is a core feature of the ERP, designed to give real-time updates about Leads, Clients, Dispatch events.

It MUST remain visible on specific pages and organizations.
It MUST NOT be removed completely.


---

1. WHERE TO SHOW THE LEAD NOTIFICATIONS PANEL

✅ Show this sticky Lead Notifications Panel on these routes ONLY:

✅ It should load automatically whenever a user lands on their Dashboard Home (inside allowed organizations).

✅ It should remain sticky at the top inside Dashboard — and scroll if the user scrolls the page.


---

2. WHERE TO HIDE THE LEAD NOTIFICATIONS PANEL

✅ Hide this sticky tab on:

CRM (All Leads, SQL, MQL, Clients subpages)

Dispatch Loads

Dispatch Clients

Dispatch New Load

Invoices

Finance

HR

Marketing

Profile

Settings

Admin Management

Time Tracking

Reports


✅ Also hide it on:

Any Load detail page

Any Invoice detail page

Any Lead or Client expanded pages

3. IMPORTANT UI/UX BEHAVIOR RULES

✅ Sticky Behavior:

Stays stuck at the top of the dashboard page.

Scrolls with the page body if needed.


✅ Mobile View:

The Lead Notifications tabs must be fully responsive (previous instructions).

Horizontal scroll allowed.

Proper padding/margin applied so it doesn’t feel crammed on small screens.


✅ Load Behavior:

Do NOT show loading spinner unless needed.

Load a simple skeleton/placeholder if real data takes more than 1 second to load.


✅ Performance:

Do not reload notifications on every click inside the dashboard. Only reload when dashboard is refreshed or revisited.



---

4. SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPLIT BOT

IMPORTANT:

DO NOT delete the Lead Notifications component.

DO NOT comment out its imports or code.

DO NOT remove backend routes feeding it data.

DO NOT hide it globally.


✅ Only implement proper conditional rendering based on organization + current page route.

✅ Keep the component wired up to real-time updates if socket or push is enabled.

✅ Always test on both Desktop and Mobile.


---

✅ FINAL ACCEPTED BEHAVIOR

✅ When user logs in and lands on Dashboard → Lead Notifications Panel is clearly visible.

✅ When user navigates to non-dashboard pages → Lead Notifications Panel is hidden.

✅ Mobile View shows clean, scrollable tabs, no breaking layout.

✅ Switching between dashboards should correctly load/unload the sticky notifications without crash.

✅ No missing tabs, no errors in console.

✅ Performance should not degrade — lightweight loading.
