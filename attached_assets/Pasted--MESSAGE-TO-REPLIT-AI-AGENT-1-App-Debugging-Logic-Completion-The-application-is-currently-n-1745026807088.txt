
MESSAGE TO REPLIT AI AGENT:

1. App Debugging & Logic Completion
The application is currently not functioning properly.
 Your immediate job is to:


Diagnose and fix all existing bugs


Make the application runnable without errors


Identify and resolve any missing workflows, incomplete modules, broken logic, or faulty state changes


Ensure all logic connections between Sales, Dispatch, Invoicing, and Dashboard are working smoothly end-to-end



2. Organizational Hierarchy Setup
This product (Metio) will be used for multiple organizations under one parent company.


Structure it as follows:


Parent: MetaSys


Organization 1: MetaSys Logistics (move all existing app data and logic under this)


Organization 2: MetaSys Solutions (we will configure this later)


Make the app multi-org capable:


Add the ability to create new organizations


Assign team members to specific organizations


Ensure all data, roles, teams, permissions, dashboards, and modules are isolated per organization



3. Missing Modules, Features & Broken Pages
There are several areas where the UI is present but functionality is missing. Fix and complete all of the following:
Team Management:


Ability to add new team members


Invite users by email or username


Assign them to a specific department/team


Assign them a role or permission level (e.g., Admin, Manager, Rep)


Profile section must include:


User Info (Name, Email, Org, Team)


Role


Status (Active/Inactive)


Clock-in history


Leave summary


User Roles & Permissions:


Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)


Prevent users from accessing other departments/modules unless permitted


Profile Management:


Add profile view/edit page for each user


Profile should include personal info, role, team, and last login activity



4. New Modules to Add
You must create new main modules in the side navigation, and basic UI skeletons + functionality for each:
A. Finance
Revenue tracking (pull from Invoicing)


Expense logging (salaries, tools, marketing, etc.)


Monthly/Quarterly P&L summaries


Forecasting


B. Human Resources
Subsections:


Talent Acquisition (Candidate list, pipeline stages, job postings)


People & Culture (Employee feedback, engagement)


Onboarding Checklist (custom checklist per department/role)


Leave Requests & Approvals


Employee Directory


C. Marketing
Core module for managing inbound marketing


Placeholder sections for:


Campaigns


Landing Pages


Content Library


Leads / MQLs / CTAs


Future integrations: (e.g., HubSpot, Mailchimp, etc.)


Add the structural logic now. We will build integrations later.

5. UI Enhancements
The interface is currently too flat. Apply the following improvements:


Add hover effects to buttons and cards


Include subtle animations or transitions (e.g., fade-in on cards, slide on sidebar)


Add basic visual hierarchy with padding, shadows, or accent borders


Use brand colors consistently for button states (hover, active, disabled)



Ensure everything above is implemented properly. No placeholders. All components should be functional and connected to the backend where applicable. Confirm when itâ€™s done so we can proceed to the next set of updates.
