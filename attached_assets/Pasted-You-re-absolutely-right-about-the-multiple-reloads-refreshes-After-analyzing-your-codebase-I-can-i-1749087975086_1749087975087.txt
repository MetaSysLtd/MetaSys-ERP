You're absolutely right about the multiple reloads/refreshes. After analyzing your codebase, I can identify several specific causes for this behavior:

Root Causes of Multiple Renders/Reloads:
1. React Query Cache Invalidation Loop
In your console logs, I can see the same API endpoints being called repeatedly within seconds:

1:35:23 AM [express] GET /api/dashboard/widgets 200 in 223ms
1:35:24 AM [express] GET /api/dashboard/widgets 200 in 224ms
1:35:25 AM [express] GET /api/dashboard/widgets 200 in 223ms
This is happening because of your query configuration in client/src/lib/queryClient.ts:

defaultOptions: {
  queries: {
    refetchInterval: false,
    refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
    staleTime: Infinity,
    retry: false,
  }
}
But individual queries override this with shorter staleTime:

// From use-dashboard-data.tsx
const kpiMetricsQuery = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['/api/dashboard/metrics'],
  staleTime: 30000, // Cache for 30 seconds - TOO SHORT
});
2. Multiple Dashboard Data Hooks Running Simultaneously
In client/src/pages/dashboard/index.tsx, you're running TWO data fetching systems:

// Hook 1: Custom parallel loading
const {
  isLoading: criticalDataLoading,
  // ... other data
} = useDashboardData();
// Hook 2: Additional dashboard query
const dashboardQuery = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["/api/dashboard", dateRange, department],
  queryFn: async () => {
    // ... fetch logic
  },
  refetchInterval: 30000, // EVERY 30 SECONDS!
});
3. Animation Context State Updates Triggering Re-renders
In client/src/contexts/AnimationContext.tsx, multiple useState calls trigger re-renders:

const [animationsEnabled, setAnimationsEnabled] = useState(uiPreferences.animationsEnabled);
const [reducedMotion, setReducedMotion] = useState(uiPreferences.reducedMotion);
const [transitionSpeed, setTransitionSpeed] = useState<TransitionSpeed>(
  uiPreferences.transitionSpeed as TransitionSpeed
);
// Each of these causes a re-render when updated
4. Socket Connection/Reconnection Loop
Your socket logs show constant connect/disconnect cycles:

["Removing handler for connect"]
["Setting up handler for connect"]
["Removing handler for disconnect"] 
["Setting up handler for disconnect"]
This happens because socket event handlers are being added/removed on every render.

5. Rapid Query Key Changes
Dependencies like dateRange and department in query keys cause instant refetches:

queryKey: ["/api/dashboard", dateRange, department],
When these change, all dashboard queries re-execute.

6. Loading State Management Conflicts
Multiple loading states compete:

// From use-dashboard-data.tsx
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
const [hasTimedOut, setHasTimedOut] = useState(false);
// Plus React Query loading states from each individual query
// Plus component-level loading states
7. Animation useEffect Loops
The animation context has multiple timeouts that can trigger state updates:

// From AnimationContext.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const criticalTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
    // State update triggers re-render
    setIsLoading(false);
  }, 300);
  
  const mediumTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
    // Another state update
    setIsLoading(false);
  }, 600);
  
  const finalTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
    // Another state update
    setIsLoading(false);
    setHasTimedOut(true);
  }, 1000);
}, [/* dependencies that change frequently */]);
Why You See Visual "Flashing":
Initial Render: Skeleton/loading state
First Data Load: Partial data renders
Animation State Update: Component re-renders for animation preferences
Socket Connection: Re-render when socket connects
Secondary Data Load: Additional dashboard data arrives
Query Refetch: 30-second intervals trigger fresh renders
Final Settle: All data stabilizes
Specific Evidence from Your Code:
The console shows these patterns:

Same API endpoints called 3-4 times within seconds
Socket handlers constantly being removed/added
Animation and UI preference updates happening in parallel with data loading
Multiple query systems (useDashboardData + dashboardQuery) running simultaneously
Summary:
The "multiple loads" you're seeing aren't actually full page reloads - they're React component re-renders caused by:

Conflicting data fetching strategies
Short cache times causing frequent refetches
Animation context state updates
Socket connection management
Multiple competing loading states
The issue is architectural - too many systems trying to manage the same data and UI state simultaneously, each triggering their own re-renders.
