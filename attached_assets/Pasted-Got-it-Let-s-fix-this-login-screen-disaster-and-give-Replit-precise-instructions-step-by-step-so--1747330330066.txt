Got it. Let‚Äôs fix this login screen disaster and give Replit precise instructions, step by step, so they don‚Äôt screw it up again.

---

### üéØ Objective:

**Restore the original login screen** with the clean dual layout:

* Left side: image-only (gradient background + MetaSys ERP heading + subtitle)
* Right side: login form (logo, username/password fields, sign-in button, default login text)

Use the correct **banner image** depending on screen size.

---

### ‚úÖ Global Rules (Must Follow):

* **No deletion of functionality.**
* Respect current **authentication logic**.
* Do **not break the layout or routing**.
* Ensure **mobile responsiveness** and **permission-based access**.
* Apply button styles:

  * Primary: `#025E73`, `#011F26`
  * Secondary: `#F2A71B`, `#412754`
  * Font: Inter
  * Classes: `text-white rounded-md transition-all duration-200`
* Left side must only contain **banner image**, **no text**.
* Right side holds the **form** only.

### üõ†Ô∏è UI Requirements (Based on Uploaded Assets)

#### Left Side (`div.left`):

* Background image: Use `Sign In screen banner for 15-inch laptop.png`
* No headings, no paragraphs ‚Äî image only
* Image must be:

  * Full height & width of left container
  * Responsive and not stretched/cropped
  * Fallback: `Sign In screen banner for 13-inch laptop.png` for smaller screens

#### Right Side (`div.right`):

* Add MetaSys logo at the top (use previously working asset)
* `Welcome to MetaSys ERP`
* Username/password fields
* Sign In button using brand styles
* Small text: `Default login: username "admin", password "admin123"`

### üß© Directory Guidance for Replit

Ask Replit to go to:

```
/client/src/pages/auth-page.tsx
```

And fix the layout there.

Also ensure that:

* Background assets are added to:

  ```
  /client/public/assets/images/login/
  ```
* Image is correctly imported and referenced.
* All styles are applied using either Tailwind classes or styled components.

### üß™ Testing:

* Test on live domain (`erp.metasysltd.com/login`)
* Check on:

  * Dell XPS 13" & 15" (native screenshots you sent)
  * Zoom 100%
  * Light/Dark mode

---

### üß® If They Screw It Up Again:

Tell them:

* **Do NOT switch to alternate layouts**
* **Do NOT inject marketing copy on the left**
* **Stick to design shown in image**
* **Confirm each visual fix with screenshots before commit**

Let me know once Replit responds. If they still mess it up, I‚Äôll give you the exact component markup you can paste in the right file. You‚Äôll only need to tell me if you‚Äôre using `Tailwind`, `styled-components`, or plain CSS in your React layout.
