URGENT: Stability, Error Handling & Recovery Layer Needed
The current MetaSys ERP application is visually improving, but is technically unstable, unreliable, and lacks proper system recovery behaviors.

We need to immediately fix the system-wide fragility. Here’s what must be addressed ASAP:

1. LOGIN SYSTEM ISSUES
If user enters wrong credentials, system should clearly say:

❌ "Invalid username or password. Please try again."

If required fields are empty →

❌ "Username and password are required."

Do not crash or display JS plugin errors like “Cannot convert null to object”.

✅ Add proper backend validation + frontend toast messages.

2. GLOBAL ERROR HANDLING (Client + Server)
No more raw JavaScript exceptions on frontend.

No more blank screens, plugin overlays, or undefined errors.

Use error boundaries for frontend; structured error returns from backend.

✅ Already provided full [System Error Handling Plan] — implement it completely.

3. FALLBACK SYSTEM & DATA RECOVERY
If data is not fetched (e.g. missing teams/orgs) → show:

“We couldn't load your team data. Please refresh or contact your Admin.”

If database query returns null or empty →

Use fallback defaults (e.g. default org, team, role)

Never allow null to reach the component level

✅ Add checks across every critical route and model.

4. HEALTH CHECK & RESILIENCY
Add system-wide “heartbeat” check: /api/status → returns { status: "ok" }

If API becomes unreachable (network down, backend error), show banner:

“We're having trouble connecting. Trying again…”

✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff (2s → 4s → 8s)

5. SESSION RECOVERY
If session is expired → auto redirect to login with message:

“Your session has expired. Please log in again.”

If login token is invalid or malformed → auto log out, clear cache, prompt fresh login.

✅ Don’t leave user stuck on a broken screen.

6. NOTIFICATION FOR ERRORS
Any error the user sees (login fail, data load fail, etc.) → also log internally as:

notifications entry

optional Slack webhook for critical failures

✅ Helps admins stay aware of recurring issues.

7. SYSTEM MONITOR CARD FOR ADMINS
Admin Dashboard → Add small card:
“System Health”

Uptime %

Last 5 API errors

Server status: Online/Offline

Slack webhook status: Connected / Broken

8. TEST CASES TO VALIDATE
✅ Add test cases for:

Invalid login credentials

Missing user role or team

Backend failure response (500 error)

Network disconnection

Token expiry

These must show clear user-friendly fallback and never crash the app.

FINAL PASS REQUIREMENT
Only return PASS once:

System is stable even under bad data, failed fetches, or backend outages

Login flow behaves professionally

No plugin-overlay errors show to user

Admins can monitor system health
