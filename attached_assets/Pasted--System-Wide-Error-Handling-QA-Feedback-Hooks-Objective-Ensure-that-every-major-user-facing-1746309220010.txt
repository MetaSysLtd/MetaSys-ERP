🧱 System-Wide Error Handling & QA Feedback Hooks
🎯 Objective
Ensure that every major user-facing module fails gracefully, visibly, and traceably — across both desktop and mobile views. Build a feedback-first system where bugs can be reported, logged, and traced without breaking the user journey.

🔹 1. ERROR HANDLING (SYSTEM-WIDE)
🔸 Purpose
Prevent silent failures. Replace blank screens, JSON errors, or console-only errors with proper UI feedback and logs for debugging.
🔸 Key Requirements
Area
What Should Happen
404s
Show a branded “Page Not Found” with a soft prompt to return to dashboard.
API Failures
If any fetch (CRM, Dispatch, etc.) fails, show a friendly toast or error block: “We’re having trouble loading this right now. Try again or contact Admin.”
UI-level Errors
Forms should never freeze. If a form submit fails, show: “Something went wrong. Please review inputs or retry.”
Empty States
If the DB returns no results, show “No Data Found” with a tip (e.g., “Click + to add new”) instead of white space.
Auth/Session Expiry
If session expires, redirect to login with message: “You’ve been logged out for security. Please log in again.”
Mobile Handling
All error components should scale responsively. Never cut off or overflow.
Console Logging
Errors should be logged in console with endpoint, payload (redacted), and response code.
Loading States
Add visible spinners or “Loading...” on all list fetches, forms, and graphs. No UI should just hang.


🔹 2. QA FEEDBACK & ISSUE REPORTING
🔸 Goal
Allow any user (Admin, Team Member, Tester) to report bugs instantly without leaving the app — and track those reports centrally.
🔸 Key UX Flow
Sticky Button (Bottom-Right Corner)


Label: 🐞 Report Issue


Shown on every page except login and error pages


Clicking opens a small modal or drawer


Bug Report Modal Fields:


Page Auto-Captured (e.g., /dispatch/loads)


Issue Description (textarea)


Screenshot Upload (optional) (Optional, but must accept drag-drop or mobile picker)


Urgency Tag (Low, Medium, High)


Submit button


After Submit:


Show “Thank you, we’ve logged your issue. Our team will review it shortly.”


Send the issue to:


bugs table in DB


(Optional) Slack webhook or email if enabled in admin panel


Admin Access to View Reported Bugs:


Admin Module → Tab: Bug Reports


List view of: Page, Description, Screenshot, Submitted by, Timestamp, Status



🔹 3. CONNECTING TO EXISTING SYSTEM
Area
Connection
CRM, Dispatch, Invoices
All must have fetch try/catch + visible fallback state.
Login & Auth
Expiry = redirect to login with proper message.
QA Module
Bugs reported via feedback flow can be linked to QA tickets.
Admin Panel
Bug Reports tab can be used during sprints to plan fix cycles.


🧪 Suggested QA Tests
Test
Expected Result
Break /crm/leads API
Should show soft error message, not JSON dump
Go to wrong URL
Should land on 404 page with return home button
Try to add a lead with missing fields
Show field errors, not a freeze
Submit bug via button
Should store in DB and confirm
Collapse form mid-use on mobile
Should restore state or reset cleanly


✅ What to TELL Replit (no code)
“Hey Replit, we’re moving into the System-Wide Error Handling and Bug Reporting step. This involves:
Creating global error handling components for all pages (not individual fixes)


Ensuring no fetch ever fails silently — use branded UI error messages


Adding a Report Bug button globally that opens a modal for users to submit issues with optional screenshot and urgency tag


This should be connected to a bugs table or JSON log, and an admin panel view to track


DO NOT overwrite working components — just wrap fetches and add fallbacks


Mobile compatibility must be tested
 Let’s do this modularly and not touch the current working CRM/Dispatch form logic unless needed. Just add clean wrappers and fallback states.”
