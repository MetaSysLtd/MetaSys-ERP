GLOBAL RULES
1. Keep existing working code; extend, fix, or patch only.
2. Build BOTH backend (DB, API, sockets) and frontend (UI).
3. All data changes must emit socket events for real‑time dashboards.
4. Follow brand button style:Primary: #025E73, #011F26 Secondary: #F2A71B, #412754  text-white  rounded-md  transition-all  duration-200. Font = Inter (Google Fonts)
Before you build any of these features below, ensure every new function:
- Connects to the related parent module correctly (CRM, Dispatch, HR, etc.)
- Reports relevant activity back to Admin Dashboard KPIs (if applicable)
- Triggers notifications internally (Notification Center, Bell Icon, Slack)
- Is fully permission-based (who can view, who can edit)
- Follows the brand design system (primary/secondary colors, button styles)
- Is fully mobile responsive and accessible. Dark Mode also works
- No standalone isolated features are allowed.

Task: Fix broken CRM and Dispatch routes and views in MetaSys ERP.

## A. CRM Module Fixes

1. CRM > Leads is showing error: “Contact not found. The contact you're looking for doesn't exist or you don't have permission to view it.”
   - Fix this route so /crm/leads loads the full Leads list view as intended.
   - Verify that current test user has correct permissions and contact visibility.
   - Ensure database is seeded with dummy leads for test view.

2. CRM > Clients and CRM > Commissions routes also show same “Contact not found” error.
   - Fix routing and data fetch logic for both pages.
   - If no data exists yet, show empty state message — do NOT throw error.

3. Check sidebar links for these three routes:
   - /crm/leads
   - /crm/clients
   - /crm/commissions

## B. Dispatch Module Fixes

1. /dispatch/loads still shows 404 — fix this route to load Loads dashboard/table.

2. /dispatch/clients shows JSON error:
   > Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON
   - This usually means the backend returned an HTML error instead of JSON — fix the API response to return proper JSON.

3. /dispatch/new-load and /dispatch/tracking are both still broken (404).
   - Implement skeleton or fallback views even if not functional yet.
   - If incomplete, add TODO banners instead of blank screens or 404.

## Guidelines:

- Return "PASS" when all 7 pages above load without errors or show clean fallback view.
- Do NOT implement business logic here — just restore base views with error-free routes and clean layout.

After fixing, test each page and return status.
