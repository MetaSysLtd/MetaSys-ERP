Here’s exactly how you should explain this clearly and assertively to Replit:

## ⚠️ Live Environment Bug: Login Skipped, Unauthorized Dashboard Access

### 📍 What’s Happening

* I visit: **`https://erp.metasysltd.com`**
* It **should** show the **login screen** (`/login`)
* Instead, it:

  1. Briefly shows **“Loading user data...”** on `/auth`
  2. Then redirects me **straight to `/dashboard`**
  3. I never enter my credentials or see the login form

---

### 🧨 Why This Is a Serious Problem

* This is a **critical security issue**:
  Unauthenticated users can potentially **bypass login** and access protected pages
* It creates confusion between **auth states** and **redirect logic**
* The login route is being skipped entirely on first load or refresh

---

### 🎯 What It Should Do Instead

* Any unauthenticated user visiting `erp.metasysltd.com` should:

  * Be taken to `/login` (or `/auth` screen that renders the login)
  * See the sign-in form **immediately**, not the dashboard
  * Only access `/dashboard` **after valid login**

---

### 🛠 What to Investigate and Fix

Please **carefully check and fix** the following without breaking anything:

1. **Auth Provider / Context Logic**

   * Check if `useAuth` or session logic incorrectly **assumes a user is logged in**
   * Possibly defaulting to “authenticated” on first load

2. **Initial Route Handling**

   * Ensure app checks auth status **before redirecting to dashboard**
   * This is likely happening too early or without validation

3. **Browser Refresh Logic**

   * If refreshing `erp.metasysltd.com`, ensure session is actually validated before redirecting
   * Consider deferring redirect until auth state is **confirmed**

4. **Session Storage Handling**

   * Confirm if cookies or local/session storage are **misleading the app into thinking user is logged in**

5. **Live vs Dev Discrepancy**

   * This issue seems specific to **live deployment**
   * Validate that the auth state logic and routing behave the same across **dev and live builds**

### 🚫 Caution

**Do NOT disable the auth checks** or patch this by hiding the login page or skipping checks.
Fix the **auth verification logic** and route redirection **without removing features or skipping states**.

Let me know once it’s handled and I’ll retest from both fresh browser and incognito.
