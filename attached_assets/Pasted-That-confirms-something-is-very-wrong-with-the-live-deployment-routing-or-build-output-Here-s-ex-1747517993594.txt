That confirms something is very wrong with the live deployment routing or build output.

Here's exactly what to tell Replit next from your **Product Manager** role:

### 🛑 URGENT: Live Production Build Broken – Landing on Raw HTML/CSS

When visiting the main production domain `https://erp.metasysltd.com`, the browser **renders raw CSS variables** and does not load the actual app.

---

### 📍Observed Behavior:

* The page displays a stylesheet dump like:

  ```
  :root {
    --background: 215 100% 98%;
    --foreground: ...
    ...
  }
  ```
* No HTML content or React app appears.
* This is happening even without login or interaction.

---

### 🔎 What This Likely Means:

1. The **frontend build is corrupted or not deployed properly**.
2. The default route (`/`) or the fallback route is broken or **not serving `index.html`**.
3. **React Router or Next.js routes** might not be handling root path requests (`/auth`, `/`, etc.).
4. The deployment server might be serving the wrong file type (e.g. CSS or raw text instead of bundled app).

---

### ✅ Actions Needed:

1. Recheck the deployment pipeline:

   * Is the `build` folder generated correctly?
   * Is `index.html` present and set as the root entry point?
   * Are all public routes (e.g. `/`, `/auth`, `/login`) correctly resolved to the React app?
2. In Replit’s deployment settings:

   * Check that the correct build command and output folder are defined.
   * Rebuild manually if needed to ensure a clean build.
3. Add a **fallback route in your frontend routing logic**:

   * If route not found, **redirect to `/login` or `/auth`**, not crash or dump styles.
4. Verify server settings:

   * Ensure the express/static or proxy logic (if any) is pointing to the `dist` or `build` folder.

---

### 🧩 Bonus Debug Clue:

* You may have **accidentally set the `/` route or root index to return a stylesheet or theme object**, not the main app.
* Or your production build is **missing React root mount point** (`<div id="root">`).

Tell Replit to urgently rebuild the live deployment cleanly, ensure all routes fall back correctly to your login screen, and verify the production frontend is serving the actual application.

Let me know once this is fixed—we’ll revalidate dashboard access and routing.
