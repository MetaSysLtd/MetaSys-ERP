🔧 OVERVIEW OF ISSUES IN THE CURRENT DASHBOARD UI (Based on Screenshot)
1. Persistent Error Message
	• "Error loading historical data – Failed to fetch historical commission data: 401"
		○ This should never be a visible red error on a production dashboard.
		○ It is disruptive and makes the system feel broken even if other data works.
✅ Fix Instruction:
	• If commission history fails to load:
		○ Fallback to default state: show No historical data available yet inside the card.
		○ Only log the 401 in the dev console — do not show red toast notifications or hard errors on screen for expected empty states.

2. Broken Card Responsiveness on High-Res Screens (e.g. Dell XPS 9310)
	• Cards like “Pending Invoices” and “Total Revenue” are:
		○ Misaligned or cut off
		○ Overflowing on wider screens
		○ Texts break into new lines prematurely (e.g., Dispatch clients in date range)
✅ Fix Instruction:
	• Apply a grid container for MetricCards with:
display: grid;grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(240px, 1fr));gap: 16px;
	• For text inside cards:
		○ Use text-wrap: balance; for headings
		○ Use overflow-wrap: break-word for subtext
		○ Fix padding inconsistencies
Also ensure consistent height and icon/text spacing in all cards.

3. Inconsistent UI Styling
	• Yellow borders appear on some cards, not all
	• Cards lack consistent hover/active states
	• Some icons (shopping cart, revenue, pie) appear misaligned vertically
✅ Fix Instruction:
	• All MetricCards must use:
.box-style {  border-radius: 12px;  box-shadow: 0px 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.06);  border: 1px solid #D6D6D6;  padding: 16px;  background-color: white;}
	• All icons should be:
		○ Center-aligned
		○ Uniform 36px x 36px
		○ With consistent margin from text (e.g. margin-bottom: 4px)

4. Missing or Misleading Labels
	• The cards don’t always tell you what exactly they represent
		○ “Total Leads” → should mention if it’s MTD/WTD
		○ “Profit Margin” → doesn’t say “for this month”
		○ “View Details” → no indication where it will take the user
✅ Fix Instruction:
	• Add subtle grey sublabels inside cards like:
[Title] – Total Revenue[Subtext] – For selected month
	• Update all “View details” links to show a tooltip or route preview on hover.

5. Animation Toggle Bug
From your earlier message — the animation toggle was breaking rendering.
✅ Fix Instruction:
	• That toggle should be removed entirely until stable, or:
		○ Default it to OFF
		○ Save toggle preference to localStorage so state persists properly
		○ Add fallback: if animations break component rendering, bypass animation state and render static

✅ Sample Message for Replit:

	The current Admin Dashboard still has key issues:
		1. DO NOT show red error toasts for 401s – fallback to empty state blocks inside cards instead of displaying "Failed to load historical data" in red.
		2. Fix responsiveness – cards break layout on Dell XPS 9310 and other high-res laptops. Use a responsive grid layout with minmax(240px, 1fr) columns. Normalize padding, heights, and font sizes.
		3. Unify design language – All metric cards must follow the same box-shadow, icon, font weight, border-radius, and yellow-highlight logic.
		4. Fix animation toggle bug – Currently, when animation is ON, widgets fail to load. Disable animations until stabilized or default OFF with a safe fallback.
		5. Clarify all metric cards – Add sublabels (e.g. “MTD”, “for this month”), and ensure “View details” is clear about where it takes the user.
	Please DO NOT remove any components. Just gracefully fallback to defaults when there is no data yet.
