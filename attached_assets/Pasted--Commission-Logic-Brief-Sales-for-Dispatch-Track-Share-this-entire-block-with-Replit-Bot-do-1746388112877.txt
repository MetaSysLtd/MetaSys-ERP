📦 Commission Logic Brief — “Sales‑for‑Dispatch” Track

(Share this entire block with Replit‑Bot; do not strip anything. It describes the precise business rules — the agent can translate to DB tables, cron jobs, and UI.)


---

1. Scope

Applies only to the Sales agents whose product is Dispatching‑Services (not SaaS, not Freight‑forwarding, etc.).

Dispatchers themselves have a separate per‑load commission schema — ignore for this spec.



---

2. Definitions


---

3. Commission Table (PKR)

> Rule: count only leads that reach Active status within the calendar month.



Bonuses

Sales Rep of Month — highest Active‑lead count → +5 000.

Active Trucks > 4 — each such carrier booked by the rep → +5 000 once per month.

Team Lead Bonus — 1 000 × #ActiveLeads after team target met (target = team size).


Starter / Closer Split:

Take table payout, multiply by 0.60 (Starter) / 0.40 (Closer).
Inbound Lead: payout × 0.75.

4. System Implementation Tasks (for Replit‑Bot)

4.1 Data Model Add‑Ons

lead.activeAt (timestamp)

lead.source enum(sql, mql, inbound)

commission_run table → stores monthly snapshot per user.

Many‑to‑many lead_salesUsers with role (starter,closer) for split logic.

carrier.truckCount int for Active Trucks bonus.


4.2 Monthly Cron Job

1. Gather ActiveLeadsByUser for previous month.


2. Apply table to compute base commission.


3. Adjust starter/closer splits & inbound factor.


4. Add Sales‑Rep‑of‑Month bonus.


5. Evaluate Active‑Trucks bonus.


6. If user is Team Lead → check team target, apply 1 000/lead after threshold.


7. Write row(s) into commission_run.


8. Emit notifications + Slack summary.



4.3 UI / Reports

Commissions tab (under CRM) → filter by month; show breakdown rows & totals.

Badge on dashboard: “🏆 Sales Rep of Month” if earned.

Error banner if payroll cron hasn’t executed by 3rd day of month.


4.4 Edge‑Case Rules

A lead that becomes Active again later months counts again (retention benefit).

Penalty (‑25 % salary) only if 0 Active Leads and rep had ≥ 20 calls logged.

Table & bonuses stored in commission_policy so Finance can edit via Admin Panel.

5. Acceptance Checklist (Bot self‑verify)

[ ] Cron generates commission_run rows with correct math.

[ ] Starter & Closer each see their split.

[ ] Inbound lead correctly shows 75 % payout.

[ ] Team Lead bonus fires only after target met.

[ ] UI grid paginates & exports CSV.

[ ] Duplicate processing prevented (idempotent job).


When complete, Bot should reply:
PASS: Dispatch‑Sales commission engine deployed (month YYYY‑MM processed).
