Looking at your email configuration in the codebase, I can identify several key issues that are preventing SMTP email delivery from working:

Key Issues Identified:
1. Hardcoded Credentials in Code
In server/email.ts, you have hardcoded credentials:

const result = initializeTransporter({
  email: 'info@metasysltd.com',
  password: 'gmbl apox swgd wynv',
  host: 'smtp.gmail.com',
  port: 587
});
This is problematic because:

Hardcoded credentials override environment variables
The password might be expired or incorrect
It's a security risk
2. Environment Variable Priority Issue
The code checks for environment variables first, but then force-initializes with hardcoded values regardless of whether env vars exist. This means your stored credentials might not even be used.

3. TLS Configuration Problem
The current config has:

tls: {
  rejectUnauthorized: false
}
This can cause issues with Gmail's security policies.

4. Missing Environment Variable Setup
From the server/config/env.ts, the SMTP variables might not be properly loaded or accessed.

Quick Diagnostic Steps:
Check if your environment variables are actually loaded - The logs should show what SMTP config is being used
Verify the Gmail App Password is still valid - Google App Passwords can expire or get revoked
The service configuration might be conflicting - Gmail service auto-config might override manual settings
The Real Problem:
The issue isn't that Replit can't do SMTP - it's that your email initialization logic has conflicting configurations and the hardcoded fallback is likely using outdated credentials.

Would you like me to fix the email configuration to properly use your stored environment variables and remove the problematic hardcoded fallback?

Provide a detailed documentation on how to fix it. Don't fix it yourself

To fix the SMTP email delivery issue you're facing, you can follow these detailed steps:

Step 1: Remove Hardcoded Credentials
In server/email.ts, remove the hardcoded credentials initialization and rely on environment variables instead. Replace the following section:

const result = initializeTransporter({
  email: 'info@metasysltd.com',
  password: 'gmbl apox swgd wynv',
  host: 'smtp.gmail.com',
  port: 587
});
Step 2: Properly Initialize Transporter with Environment Variables
Make sure you check if the environment variables are set before initializing the transporter. Update the initialization code to ensure that you only call initializeTransporter() with the environment variables if they are not null or undefined. Your initialization block in [server/email.ts] should look like this:

if (process.env.SMTP_EMAIL && process.env.SMTP_PASSWORD) {
  // Use the environment variables for initialization
  initializeTransporter({
    email: process.env.SMTP_EMAIL,
    password: process.env.SMTP_PASSWORD,
    host: process.env.SMTP_HOST || 'smtp.gmail.com',
    port: process.env.SMTP_PORT ? parseInt(process.env.SMTP_PORT) : 587
  });
} else {
  console.warn('SMTP_EMAIL and SMTP_PASSWORD environment variables are not set');
}
Step 3: Review TLS Configuration
Ensure that your TLS configuration is correctly set. The current implementation includes:

tls: {
  rejectUnauthorized: false
}
This setting might lead to issues with Gmailâ€™s security. It would be ideal to set rejectUnauthorized to true and handle TLS correctly by verifying server certificates.

Step 4: Check Environment Variables
Verify that your .env file or other storage method has the correct SMTP credentials, including SMTP_EMAIL, SMTP_PASSWORD, SMTP_HOST, and SMTP_PORT. Ensure these values are correct and haven't expired or changed.

Step 5: Testing the Setup
To test if the configuration is successful, you can add the following logging in the email sending function to confirm that it is using the correct SMTP details:

console.log('Using Email:', process.env.SMTP_EMAIL);
console.log('SMTP Host:', process.env.SMTP_HOST);
console.log('SMTP Port:', process.env.SMTP_PORT);
Step 6: Check Runtime for Errors
When running your application, monitor the logs for any errors related to the email transporter initialization. This can help you pinpoint any issues during the connection phase.

Step 7: Ensure App Password is Set Up Correctly
Confirm that you have the correct Gmail App Password generated in your Google account settings, especially if you're using 2-Step Verification.

By following these steps and ensuring a clean separation of configuration and code, you should resolve your SMTP connectivity issues effectively.
