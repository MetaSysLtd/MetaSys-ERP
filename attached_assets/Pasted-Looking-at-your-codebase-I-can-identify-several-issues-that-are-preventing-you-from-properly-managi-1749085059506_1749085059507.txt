Looking at your codebase, I can identify several issues that are preventing you from properly managing the admin profile and user accounts. Let me break down the problems:

Core Issues Identified
1. Hard-coded Admin Account
The main problem is in your authentication system. Looking at the code patterns, it appears you have a default admin account that's likely hard-coded or seeded with default credentials. This is a major security vulnerability.

2. Profile Update Issues
From the client/src/pages/settings/profile.tsx and related files, I can see the profile update functionality exists, but there are several potential issues:

Permission Problems:

The server/middleware.ts shows restrictions on updating certain fields like username, firstName, lastName, roleId
The middleware requires level 5+ permissions or HR roles to modify restricted fields
If the admin user doesn't have the right permission level, updates will fail
API Endpoint Issues:

The profile update uses PATCH /api/users/{id} but there might be validation or permission conflicts
Password changes use a separate endpoint /api/users/{id}/password which requires current password verification
3. User Invitation System Missing
I don't see a proper user invitation/registration system in your codebase. The authentication appears to only handle login for existing users.

Specific Problems to Fix
A. Admin Profile Cannot Be Modified
Root Cause: The middleware in server/middleware.ts and server/routes/users.ts has restrictive permission checks that might be preventing the admin from updating their own profile.

Issues Found:

The user update endpoint requires either:

User updating their own profile (but restricted fields are blocked)
Admin level permissions (level 5+)
HR role permissions
If your default admin user doesn't have level 5+ or the right role configuration, they can't update restricted fields.

B. Password Change Problems
Root Cause: The password change endpoint in server/routes/users.ts requires the current password to be provided and verified before allowing updates.

Issues Found:

The password verification uses plain text comparison: if (user.password !== currentPassword)
No password hashing is implemented
If you don't know the current password, you can't change it
C. No User Management Interface
Root Cause: While admin components exist (client/src/components/admin/users/), there's no proper user creation/invitation flow accessible to the admin.

What Needs to be Fixed
1. Fix Admin User Permissions
Ensure the default admin user has level: 5 and isSystemAdmin: true
Check the database seeding/migration to set proper admin permissions
2. Fix Profile Update Permissions
Allow system admins to update their own restricted fields
Ensure the permission middleware properly recognizes admin privileges
3. Implement Proper Password Security
Add password hashing (bcrypt)
Allow system admins to reset passwords without current password
Implement secure password change workflow
4. Add User Management
Create user invitation system
Add user creation interface for admins
Implement email invitation workflow
5. Database Issues
Check if the admin user exists in the database with proper permissions
Verify role assignments and permission levels
Ensure user table has all required fields
Immediate Action Items
Check Database State: Verify your admin user's role level and permissions in the database
Review Middleware Logic: The permission checks might be too restrictive for system admins
Password Reset Capability: Implement a way for system admins to change passwords without current password verification
User Creation Flow: Build the missing user invitation/creation functionality
The core issue is that your system was built with user management in mind, but the initial admin setup and permission system isn't properly configured to allow the admin to bootstrap the system and manage their own account.
