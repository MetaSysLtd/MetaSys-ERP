STEP 4: Dispatch Module Core Fixes


---

Overview

Now that CRM’s backend is stabilizing, Step 4 focuses on getting the Dispatch Module to work in sync.
Think of it as the operational engine where leads become paying clients.

This module enables your dispatchers to book loads, manage clients, add notes, and trigger invoices.

Core Goals of Step 4


---

Key Pages to be Built or Fixed

1. /dispatch/clients

Table of all active clients (from CRM → Active)

Columns: Name, Location, Onboarded Date, Last Load, Value Booked

“View” button to go into client detail

Use placeholder data if backend not ready



2. /dispatch/loads

Table of all loads (filterable by date/client)

Columns: Load ID, Client, Rate, Dispatcher, Status

Each row has action menu (Edit, Invoice, Track)



3. /dispatch/new-load

Form to create a new load:

Fields: Client (dropdown), Rate, Pickup, Drop, Service Fee, Comments

Required validations for Rate, Client, Pickup/Drop

Submit = Save + show in /loads


Pre-fill client from CRM if coming via sync



4. /dispatch/tracking

Show simple table or cards of current loads

Columns: Load ID, Client, Status, Last Update

Later: Add filters (Delivered, In Transit, Booked)

Important Functional Notes


---

UI Guidelines (Flexible)

Use MetaSys branding colors (Primary: #025E73, Accent: #F2A71B)

Table layout like CRM

Use modals for load creation if not navigating to new page

Placeholder dummy data where APIs not working



---

Common Bugs We Should Prevent


---

How This Connects to Other Systems

CRM Sync: Active Lead → Dispatch Client

Finance: Load value will affect revenue tracking

Invoice: Load data will feed into Invoice Module

Gamification: Loads booked = bonus/scorecard metric

Notifications: Can later trigger “Load Booked” alert

Final Summary for Replit Agent (Human-style)

> We're now moving to bring the Dispatch module to life.
This is the main operational unit for our platform — where real value is booked.
Focus on:

A clean way to see Dispatch Clients

A reliable Load Booking form (with validations)

Ability to track loads

Smooth CRM → Dispatch sync logic

Smart use of permissions


Don’t break what’s already working.
If an API route fails, return dummy data but keep the UI ready.
Follow the same branding + UI pattern as CRM.
Assume Dispatcher is a logged-in user and only sees their own data.
