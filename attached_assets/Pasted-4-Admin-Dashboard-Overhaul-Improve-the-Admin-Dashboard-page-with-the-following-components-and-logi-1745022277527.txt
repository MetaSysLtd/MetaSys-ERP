4. Admin Dashboard Overhaul
Improve the Admin Dashboard page with the following components and logic:
A. KPI Cards Section (top row):
Total Leads (This Month) — show only leads created in current month.


Active Clients — keep this as it is.


Total Loads (This Month) — filter by current month only.


Invoices (This Month) — this refers to billed invoices, not cleared.


B. Team Performance Section:
Split this into Sales Performance and Dispatch Performance.


Sales Graph KPIs:


Average Calls per Day (manual input or integration with Nextiva/RingCentral later)


Conversion Rate


Team Target vs. Achieved


Dispatch Graph KPIs:


Loads Completed per Dispatcher


Invoices Generated by each Dispatcher


Team-level Load Count vs. Goal


C. Onboarding Ratio:
Add a card showing Onboarded Ratio:


Leads Converted by Sales vs. Activated/Onboarded by Dispatch (first load done).


D. Activity Feed:
Clarify what’s being tracked here. If it's real-time logs (new lead added, invoice sent, load completed, etc.), confirm it.


Show most recent 5–10 activities, updated live.


E. Recent Leads Panel:
Expand this with:


Latest remarks from Dispatch


Lead status


Assigned Agent


F. Commission Breakdown:
Clean this section up.


Clarify that commissions = what company owes agents.


Highlight:


Who is earning the most commission this month (across Sales + Dispatch)


Team-wise breakdown


Total company liability in commissions this month


G. Revenue / Invoicing Card (New):
One large section showing:

Invoices Pending


Breakdown by:

H. Company Finance Overview (New):

I. Employee Summary Card (New):
Table or card showing:

Clock-outs (yesterday)


Number of leaves this month


Missing entries or irregularities


J. Additional Suggestions:
Add filters at the top (Date Range, Department, Team, Agent).


Make all cards exportable (CSV or PDF).


Allow toggling between views: Table, Graph, Summary.


Ensure mobile responsiveness.
