Here’s a structured instruction for Replit that delivers your request clearly, from a Product + CX/UX angle — with full logic, workflow, and frontend placement. This ensures the ERP behaves like a real system-admin platform (like HubSpot or Salesforce):

Request: Global Admin Control to Edit or Delete Any Data

1. Business Logic

As System Admin / Super Admin, I must be able to:

View, Edit, or Delete any record in the platform
(Leads, Clients, Invoices, HR Records, Finance Entries, Loads, Time Tracking, Leave Logs, Commissions, etc.)

Override standard user restrictions (sales, finance, dispatchers)

Clean up or correct data without relying on backend/manual DB fixes


This is critical for internal governance, error correction, and platform reliability.


---

2. UX/UI Expectations

a. Every Module Screen (Table/List View) Must:

Show full data table (like it does now), but:

If the logged-in user is an Admin, show two additional actions in each row:

Edit (pencil icon or “Edit” button)

Delete (trash icon or “Delete” in kebab menu)



b. Edit Behavior (Frontend):

Clicking “Edit” opens a modal or detail page

All fields are prefilled and editable (except system-generated IDs)

Required fields must validate before update

On submit: show loader, success/fail toast, update view


c. Delete Behavior (Frontend):

Clicking “Delete” prompts a confirmation modal

Text: “Are you sure you want to permanently delete this record? This action cannot be undone.”

Buttons: Cancel | Delete

After deletion: row disappears, success toast appears


d. Permissions Logic:

Only users with role = System Admin or Super Admin can:

See Edit/Delete icons

Perform data overrides

3. Consistency Across Modules

This logic should apply to:

Module	Records

CRM	Leads, Clients, Accounts, Activities, Commissions
Dispatch	Loads, Carrier Records
Invoices	Invoice Entries, Status
Finance	Transaction Logs, Rate Cards
HR	Team Members, Leave Logs, Time Tracking
Marketing	Campaign Logs, Lead Sources
Admin Dashboard	Scheduled Tasks, Roles, Users, Settings



---

4. Additional Enhancements (Optional)

Audit Trail: When a record is edited or deleted by Admin, store a log (timestamp + Admin ID + previous value)

Soft Delete Toggle: Optional setting to soft-delete (mark as “Inactive”) instead of full deletion

Global Search (Admin Only): Search and jump to any record (by ID, phone, email) from the top nav



---

5. Placement (UX Reference for Replit)

Example: On CRM > Leads page (List View)

| Company     | Status   | Contact | Actions (Standard) | Actions (If Admin)       |
|------------|----------|---------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| ABC Co.    | Active   | John    | View                | View | Edit | Delete        |

Buttons styled consistently with platform tokens

Hover states and modals must follow same shadow, radius, spacing patterns from Phase 1 design system



---

Final Summary for Replit

> Build a universal system admin control that enables editing and deleting any record from any module in the ERP, strictly for users with “System Admin” or “Super Admin” roles.

Every list/table view in the platform should include Edit and Delete options when accessed by an Admin.

These actions must show clear modals, validate user input, handle success/error states, and update the UI in real-time.
