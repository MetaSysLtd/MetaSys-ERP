Based on my analysis of your codebase, logs, and routing structure, I can identify several critical issues that need immediate attention. Let me first test some of the previously identified issues and then find additional ones.

Testing Previously Identified Issues
Looking at the logs and codebase, I can confirm several issues are still present:

1. Route Inconsistencies Still Active
Frontend calls /api/organization/current (singular) but backend defines /api/organizations/current (plural)
This is causing 404s as seen in the logs
2. Missing Backend Routes for CRM Module
/api/crm/accounts - Route doesn't exist in the backend
/api/crm/form-templates - Missing implementation
/api/crm/qualification - Missing implementation
/api/crm/surveys - Missing implementation
3. Database Schema vs Implementation Gaps
According to project_inventory.json, these features have schema but missing tables:

Notifications - "notifications (schema exists but table missing)"
Tasks - "tasks (schema exists but table missing)"
Time Tracking - "time_clock_entries (schema exists but table missing)"
Additional Critical Issues Found
4. Protected Route Authentication Gaps
Looking at server/middleware/auth.ts, several routes lack proper role-based access control:

Admin routes require level 3+ but some pages don't enforce this
Settings pages like commission policies may not have proper auth middleware
Cross-module data access lacks permission checks
5. Frontend Page Components Without Backend Support
From client/src/App.tsx, these pages exist but lack backend implementation:

/gamification - Frontend page exists but no backend routes
/client-portal - Frontend page exists but limited backend functionality
/marketing - Frontend page exists but no backend implementation
/time-tracking - Frontend page exists but backend shows missing tables
6. API Endpoint Naming Inconsistencies
Multiple inconsistencies in route naming:

/api/organization/current vs /api/organizations/current
/api/crm/leads vs /api/leads (both exist, causing confusion)
/api/auth/user-organizations vs /api/users/organizations
7. Socket Connection Issues
From the logs, I can see socket connection problems:

Socket handlers being registered multiple times
Authentication failures in socket connections
Missing socket event handlers for some real-time features
8. Error Handler Middleware Issues
Looking at server/middleware/error-handler.ts, there are gaps:

Session expiry not properly handled for all routes
404 handler may interfere with frontend routing
Error responses not standardized across all modules
9. Missing API Routes in Route Registration
From server/routes/index.ts, some modules are registered but their route files are incomplete:

Finance Module - Registered but implementation is minimal
Marketing Module - Registered but no actual routes defined
Time Tracking - Registered but database tables missing
10. Authentication Context Issues
In client/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx, there are potential infinite loop issues:

Auth check count logic may not prevent all infinite loops
Role fetching failures not properly handled
Session keepalive may cause performance issues
New Critical Issues Identified
11. Database Migration Not Applied
The project has schema definitions but tables aren't created, indicating migration issues.

12. Real-time Socket Events Missing Handlers
Many socket events are registered but don't have corresponding backend emission logic.

13. Cross-Module Data Flow Broken
The server/routes/cross-module.ts is registered but the actual data sharing between modules is incomplete.

14. Settings Pages Incomplete Backend
Settings like commission policies have frontend pages but incomplete backend CRUD operations.

15. Admin Panel Route Conflicts
Admin routes use both /api/admin and module-specific admin routes, causing confusion and potential security gaps.

Immediate Action Needed
The most critical issues to fix first:

Route naming consistency - Fix organization/organizations mismatch
Database table creation - Apply missing migrations
Authentication middleware - Ensure all protected routes are properly secured
CRM module completion - Add missing backend routes
Error handling standardization - Fix 404/401 response consistency
These issues are preventing core functionality from working properly and creating security vulnerabilities. The application needs these fundamental fixes before adding new features.
