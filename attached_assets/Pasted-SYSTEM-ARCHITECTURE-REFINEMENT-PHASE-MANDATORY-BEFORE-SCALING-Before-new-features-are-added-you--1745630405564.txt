SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE: REFINEMENT PHASE (MANDATORY BEFORE SCALING)
Before new features are added, you must refactor the codebase and architecture to follow long-term principles that prevent system instability, reduce regressions, and improve developer velocity.

This includes folder structures, state management, modularity, error handling, testing, logging, deployment practices, and observability.

1. FILE & FOLDER STRUCTURE – MONOREPO CLEANLINESS
✅ Client and Server must be clearly separated.

bash
Copy
Edit
root/
  client/               # React (TS), Tailwind
    components/
    pages/
    modules/
    store/
    utils/
    hooks/
    services/
    types/
  server/               # Express (TS), PostgreSQL, Drizzle
    routes/
    controllers/
    models/
    services/
    middleware/
    utils/
    config/
✅ Every module (CRM, Dispatch, HR, etc.) should have its own folder with clearly scoped logic.

2. USE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
✅ All secrets (DB_URL, JWT_SECRET, SLACK_WEBHOOK, etc.) must be placed in .env:

env
Copy
Edit
DATABASE_URL=...
JWT_SECRET=...
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=...
✅ Backend config files should load env vars with fallback logic and type safety.

3. GLOBAL CONFIG & CONSTANTS
✅ Centralize all roles, permissions, statuses, and enums:

ts
Copy
Edit
export const ROLES = ['admin', 'sales', 'dispatch', 'hr', 'marketing']
export const LEAD_STATUSES = ['new', 'in_progress', 'qualified', 'won', 'lost']
✅ No hardcoded strings in components — use constants or enums.

4. FRONTEND STATE MANAGEMENT (IMPROVE MAINTAINABILITY)
✅ Use React Context or Zustand for global state, like:

Current User

Active Organization

Notifications

Theme (light/dark)

✅ Avoid prop-drilling for shared data across components.

5. ENDPOINT NAMING & API DESIGN (RESTFUL + CONSISTENT)
✅ Follow REST naming conventions:

bash
Copy
Edit
GET    /api/leads
POST   /api/leads
PUT    /api/leads/:id
DELETE /api/leads/:id
✅ For custom actions:

bash
Copy
Edit
POST /api/leads/:id/status
POST /api/notifications/mark-as-read
✅ Use pagination, filtering, and search across endpoints where large data exists.

6. DATABASE MODELING – DRIZZLE ORM BEST PRACTICE
✅ Add referential integrity: foreign keys, constraints.

✅ Use consistent naming for all tables and fields (snake_case or camelCase — pick one).

✅ Build DB indexes on:

createdAt

userId

orgId

status

✅ Run migration scripts, not ad hoc edits.

7. DATA VALIDATION (ZOD OR YUP)
✅ All frontend forms must validate before hitting API.
✅ All backend endpoints must validate input again using Zod/Yup/express-validator.

This prevents dirty/incomplete data from polluting your database.

8. SYSTEM LOGGING & AUDIT TRAILS
✅ Every critical action (login, lead updated, invoice created) must be logged:

For internal audit trails

For debugging later

✅ Console logs for dev, but structured logging (JSON format) for production.

✅ Optionally store important ones in audit_logs table:

ts
Copy
Edit
{
  _id,
  action: "create_invoice",
  userId,
  orgId,
  timestamp,
  metadata
}
9. MODULAR PERMISSION SYSTEM
✅ Replace hardcoded role checks with permission logic per route:

ts
Copy
Edit
if (!userHasPermission(user, "CAN_CREATE_LOAD")) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: "Not allowed." });
}
✅ Permissions should be:

Stored in DB

Assigned per user/role

Read via middleware per route

10. SOCKETS: ROOM-BASED ARCHITECTURE
✅ Instead of emitting to all users, use socket.io rooms:

ts
Copy
Edit
socket.join(`org:${orgId}`)
socket.join(`user:${userId}`)
✅ Emit based on:

leadAssigned → emit to user:<id>

invoiceCleared → emit to org:<orgId>

taskAssigned → emit to user:<id>

✅ Reduces noise and increases targeting accuracy.

11. DEPLOYMENT STABILITY & RECOVERY
✅ Add health check endpoint: /api/health returns { status: "ok", db: "connected" }

✅ If backend crashes, frontend shows banner: “We’re trying to reconnect…”

✅ Add try/catch + retry logic in frontend for all fetches.

12. TESTING STRATEGY
✅ Add unit tests for:

API endpoints (Jest + Supertest)

Permission middleware

Business logic functions (commission calc, lead flow)

✅ Add e2e tests (Cypress or Playwright):

Login

Create lead

Assign task

Send invoice

✅ Minimum test coverage goal: 60% backend, 40% frontend for now.

13. DOCUMENTATION (INTERNAL)
✅ Add a /docs folder with:

Onboarding.md (how to run project locally)

Architecture.md (brief)

Folder structure explanation

Setup steps for new environments

✅ Host this via GitHub Pages or Readme file until you scale more.

14. MONITORING & FAILSAFE SUGGESTION
✅ Later — integrate something like:

Sentry (frontend error tracking)

PostHog (usage analytics)

UptimeRobot (server monitoring)

Cron-based auto backups

FINAL OUTPUT
You must refactor the existing application to:

Follow the above patterns

Clean up any inconsistencies in folder structure, permissions, error flows

Add recovery mechanisms (fallbacks, retry logic, error UIs)

Move from brittle “happy path” code to resilient architecture
