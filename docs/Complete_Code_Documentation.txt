3. Real-time Updates: Inconsistent data refresh

## CODE QUALITY & ARCHITECTURE

### Strengths:
- Well-organized modular architecture
- Comprehensive error handling with global error boundaries
- TypeScript throughout for type safety
- Modern React patterns (hooks, context)
- Clean separation of concerns (services, routes, components)
- Comprehensive middleware system
- Proper database schema with relationships

### Areas for Improvement:
- Some duplicate code in components
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Missing data validation in some endpoints
- Performance optimization needed for large datasets

## SECURITY FEATURES

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The MetaSys ERP system is approximately 75-80% complete with a solid foundation. 
The CRM and Dispatch modules are the most mature, while HR and Marketing need more development. 
The architecture is sound, but there are several bugs that need fixing for production readiness.

## IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Fix authentication issues on live server
2. Resolve socket connection problems
3. Fix responsive design issues
4. Complete error handling standardization
5. Add comprehensive data validation

The system shows strong potential and has most core functionality in place, 
but needs bug fixes and polish for production deployment.
